The cost function, the total cost of for a given out- put c(y), is given by substituting 16 into the pro- duction function, rearranging for L and substitut- ing into the input function: f (16, L) = 4√L y = 4√L L = y2 16 Substitute into cost constraint c(y) = 64 + y2 16 ECO00037I University of York 1 Problem Set 3 Problem 3.1 (e) In the long run, all inputs are variable, thus like part (b), it is assumed that PaperInc minimises its costs.
