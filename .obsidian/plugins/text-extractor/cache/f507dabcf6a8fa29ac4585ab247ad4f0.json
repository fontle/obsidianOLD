They may be tempted to borrow. • However they are concerned about the possibility that they may be hit by an adverse shock in the future – their income may drop to zero. • They need to balance these competing pressures: they would like to consume their current income but they also need to build up some precautionary buffer stocks in case the worst happens. • At low levels of income, impatience may dominate, so consumption is close to income (hence ‘excess sensitivity’ of c to y) • At higher levels of income, the precautionary motive becomes more important and individuals save more.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
