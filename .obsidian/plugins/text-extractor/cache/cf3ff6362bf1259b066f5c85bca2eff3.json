Convergence? – Is there evidence that countries ‘catch up’ with other countries? – How fast is this process? 2. Quantitative relationship between GDP per capita and potential ‘drivers’ – Savings rate – ‘Institutional quality’ 4 • Similar graph of 20 OECD countries does indicate a measure of convergence • These countries are more likely to be sharing the same steady- state levels of y – same values for s and n for example. • Evidence of convergence conditional on the steady-state level.

Convergence 5 • Solow-Swan model predicts that, if all countries have same steady-state y, then rich countries will grow at slower rate than poor – absolute convergence. • If countries have different steady-state y (due, say, to different s or n), then there is conditional convergence • Real GDP growth rates of 118 countries and their initial levels of GDP - suggest absolute convergence is rejected See also Pritchett (1997) Source: Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) GDP pc Growth 1960-1985 Real GDP pc 1960 (Lack of) Convergence? 6 • Empirical cross-country estimates of convergence provide mixed results. • A more positive take is here: https:// www.cgdev.org/blog/everything-you-know-about-cross-country -convergence-now-wrong • Evidence fairly convincing in for ‘homogenous’ samples of countries/states – such as the OECD, or State-level data in the US. • But even here, there are at least open questions about the speed of convergence. • The Solow model predicts much faster convergence than that which occurs in reality.
