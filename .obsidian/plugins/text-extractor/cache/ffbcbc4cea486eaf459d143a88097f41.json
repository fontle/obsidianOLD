Huning Historical Perspectives on Economic Growth 2/ 19 Britain’s late nineteenth century decline Britain and its European Followers Questions of this Lecture ▶ How did Britain’s economy perform during the second half of the 19th century? ▶ Can the Victorian era explain Britain’s disappointing growth of the 20th century? 3/ 19 Britain’s late nineteenth century decline Britain and its European Followers 4/ 19 Britain’s late nineteenth century decline Britain and its European Followers Table 1: National shares of world manufacturing output 1860–1913 from Magee (2004, p. 81) 1860 1880 1900 1913 UK 19.9 22.9 18.5 13.6 France 7.9 7.8 6.8 6.1 Germany 4.9 8.5 13.2 14.8 Italy 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.4 Japan 2.6 2.4 2.4 2.7 USA 7.2 14.7 23.6 32 5/ 19 Britain’s late nineteenth century decline Britain and its European Followers Table 2: Levels and rate of growth of real GDP per capita from Crafts (2004) 1870 GK$ 1990 1913 GK$ 1990 Growth 1870–1913 UK 3,191 4,921 1 Germany 1,913 3,833 1.6 US 2,445 5,301 1.8 6/ 19 Britain’s late nineteenth century decline Absolute vs. Relative Decline Absolute vs. relative decline ▶ While Britain was well ahead of Germany and US, it’s growth was slower ▶ Britain is overtaken by US and Germany between 1870–1914 ▶ Contemporaries already debated over reasons 7/ 19 Britain’s late nineteenth century decline Absolute vs. Relative Decline Figure 1: Manufacturing output per person employed 1869–1907 (UK=100) from Broadberry (2005, p. 36) 8/ 19 Britain’s late nineteenth century decline Caught napping and the role of culture Figure 2: A contemporary cartoon 1 1Cartoon was published by Punch in 1896 9/ 19 Britain’s late nineteenth century decline Caught napping and the role of culture A late victory of of feudalistic culture? ▶ Wiener (1981) argues that Britain lost it’s ‘industrial spirit’ and the bourgeois turned to feudal values ▶ Rubinstein (1994) toots into the same horn, adding that British ﬁnanciers had a fetish with investment in tropical empires and were too attached to old technology 10/ 19 Britain’s late nineteenth century decline Caught napping and the role of culture McCloskey’s Revision McCloskey (1970) argues that Victorian Britain did not ‘fail’ ▶ It was rational to allocate capital where its dearest, and therefore abroad, where its rents are therefore highest ▶ British growth was as high as possible, and not an outcome of bad decisions or bad culture 11/ 19 Britain’s late nineteenth century decline Two Industrial Revolutions The two ﬁrst Industrial Revolutions ▶ First Industrial Revolution built on steam and coal: Britain is leading ▶ Main inventors and entrepreneurs (Watts, Newcomen) were British ▶ Due to high wages and low energy costs, replacing labor by coal paid oﬀ in Britain and nowhere else (Allen 2009) ▶ This lead to a slow, but steady higher growth in UK than abroad. However, technology diﬀuses ▶ Second Industrial Revolution built on electricity and combustion engines (Smil 2005) ▶ Britain had large capital stock in ‘old’ technology. Even today railroad network hardly electriﬁed ▶ Other countries could directly invest in new technology 12/ 19 Britain’s late nineteenth century decline Two Industrial Revolutions A Toy Model ▶ Assume that there are three input factors of the economy: Land, labor, and capital ▶ Initially, UK has most capital, Germany has most labor and US most land ▶ As capital is the most mobile among these factors, the initial advantage of UK will perish 13/ 19 Britain’s late nineteenth century decline Culture, again So no part for culture? Still there is some evidence for regulation prohibiting innovation ▶ Red Flag Act of 1865. All mechanically powered vehicles to be ▶ Accompanied by three persons ▶ Not to exceed 4 mph on the open road and 2 mph in towns ▶ Be preceded by one man waving a red ﬂag to warn other road users ▶ This act was withdrawn in 1896 and speed increased to 14 mph ▶ Electric Lighting Act 1882 14/ 19 Britain’s late nineteenth century decline Culture, again Figure 3: Electric Lighting Act 1882 Ch. 27 15/ 19 Britain’s late nineteenth century decline Culture, again Nick Craft’s Synthesis ▶ Crafts (2018) argues that the core of the 20th century British decline do not lie in the 19th. ▶ The reason for American overtaking lie in idiosyncratic American factors ▶ The nucleus of later failure might be seen in ▶ Britain was locked in in ’low tech’ industries, like mining and textiles, which were regionally concentrated ▶ Other governments were more active in promoting education, and Britain will fall behind both in years of schooling and university attendance ▶ A strong and de-centralized industrial relationship system 16/ 19 Britain’s late nineteenth century decline Culture, again The Hold-up of industrial Relationship ▶ There are two players, managers and trade union ▶ Both simultaneously decide ▶ Managers decide whether they reinvest a high or a small share of revenues in company ▶ Trade unions decide on a high, or small wage increase ▶ This is a prisoner’s dilemma. Assume that the optimal would be low wage increase and high investment, which would allow a stable employment with constant growth ▶ If there is no cooperation, then both parties divert, which is sup-optimal, especially for R&D 17/ 19 Britain’s late nineteenth century decline Conclusion Conclusion ▶ Britain fell into relative decline around 1870 ▶ Cultural reasons yield plausible anecdotes, but more complex ▶ Given technology diﬀusion, there should be a catch-up of latecomer economies ▶ Germany and US were better endowed, and beneﬁted from Second Industrial Revolution 18/ 19 Britain’s late nineteenth century decline Conclusion References I Allen, Robert C (2009).
