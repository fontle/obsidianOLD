Investment • Choose the best projects • Capital budgeting Financing • Choose sources of financing for investment • Capital structure Liquidity • Ensure you have enough cash and inventory • Short-term financial planning 5 A firm’s balance sheet model Current assets (e.g., cash, stock inventory) Non-current assets: • Tangible non-current assets (e.g., land, buildings, plants) • Intangible non-current assets (e.g., trademarks, patents, copyrights) Current liabilities (e.g., short-term debts) Non-current liabilities (e.g., long-term debts) Equity Total assets (what the firm owns) Total liabilities (what the firm owes others) Net working capital 6 Example 1 • On 1 March 2023, Admiral Group plc, a British motor insurer, announced its financial results for the year 2022 • At the end of 2022, the company had: • £7.7 million in tangible non-current assets and £69.0 million in intangible non- current assets • Current assets amounted to £793.6 million and current liabilities were £632.7 million • Admiral Group had no non-current liabilities • What is Admiral Group’s balance sheet model? 7 Admiral Group’s balance sheet Current assets = £793.6 mil Non-current assets: • Tangible non-current assets = £7.7 mil • Intangible non-current assets = £69 mil Current liabilities = £632.7 mil Non-current liabilities = 0 Equity = 879.3-632.7 = £237.6 mil Total assets = 793.6+7.7+69 = £870.3 mil Total liabilities = £870.3 mil Net working capital = 793.6-632.7 = £160.9 mil 8 Capital structure Debt Equity • Debt financing = borrowing money and paying back with interest • Examples: corporate bonds, loans • Providers of debts: bond holders, creditors, debt holders • Equity financing = raising money by selling equity (shares) • Providers of equity: equity holders, stockholders, shareholders If we think of a firm as a pie: Firm value = Value of bonds + Value of shares 9 What do you do as a financial manager? Responsible for investment decisions Responsible for financing decisions Responsible for short-term financial planning Oversee accounting and audit function in firm Ensure the financial welfare of the firm 10 How cash flows… 11 Accounting flow vs. Cash flow (1) • Midland plc is an Irish firm that refines and trades gold. • At the end of the year, it sold 2,500 ounces of gold for €1.67 million. • The company had acquired the gold for €1 million at the beginning of the year. The company paid cash for the gold when it was purchased. • Unfortunately, it has yet to collect from the customer to whom the gold was sold. 12 Accounting flow vs. Cash flow (2) • Accounting flow (Accounting View) Income Statement Year End December 31 Sales €1,670,000 Costs -€1,000,000 Profit € 670,000 • Cash flow (Financial View) Income Statement Year Ended December 31 Cash inflow € 0 Cash outflow -€1,000,000 Net cash flow −€1,000,000 13 Timing of cash flows The Italian firm, Montana SpA, is attempting to choose between two proposals for new products. Both proposals will provide additional cash flows over a four-year period and will initially cost €10,000. The cash flows from the proposals are as follows: Year New Product A New Product B 1 € 0 € 4,000 2 0 4,000 3 0 4,000 4 20,000 4,000 Total €20,000 €16,000 Which one is better? 14 The risk of cash flows • The Norwegian firm, Fjell ASA, is considering expanding operations overseas, and it is evaluating the Netherlands and South Africa as possible sites. The Netherlands is relatively safe, whereas operating in South Africa is seen as considerably riskier. In both cases, the company would close down operations after one year. • After undertaking a complete financial analysis, Fjell has come up with the following cash flows of the alternative plans for expansion under three scenarios—pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic: Pessimistic Most Likely Optimistic Netherlands 750,000 1,000,000 1,250,000 South Africa 0 1,500,000 2,000,000 Which one is the best?

What’s about debt holders? 10 Baxter’s balance sheet No action Assets = 900,000 Liabilities = 1,000,000 Equity = 0 New strategy – success (50%) Assets = 1,300,000 Liabilities = 1,000,000 Equity = 300,000 New strategy – failure (50%) Assets = 300,000 Liabilities = 1,000,000 Equity = 0 Equity holders get nothing Equity holders get 300,000 with 50% chance → Expected payoff = 150,000 Bond holders get 900,000 → (100,000) Bond holders get 1 mil with 50% chance and 300,000 with 50% chance → Expected payoff = 0.5 × 1 𝑚𝑖𝑙 + 0.5 × 300,000 = 650,000 → (250,000) 11 Excessive risk taking & Over-investment • The debt holders’ $250,000 loss corresponds to the $100,000 expected decline in firm value due to the risky strategy and the equity holders’ $150,000 gain Equity holders are gambling with the debt holders’ money • When a firm faces financial distress, shareholders can gain at the expense of debt holders by taking a negative-NPV project (excessive risk taking) • What can debt holders do? • pay less for the debt initially (and implement protective covenants restricting future actions) 12 Example 2 • Now assume Baxter does not pursue the risky strategy but instead the firm is considering an investment opportunity that requires an initial investment of $100,000 and will generate a risk-free return of 50% • If the current risk-free rate is 50%, this investment clearly has a positive NPV • If Baxter raises $100,000 in new equity to make the investment, who benefits? • If you were Baxter’s shareholders, would you invest in this new project? 13 Baxter’s balance sheet (raising 100,000 in equity) Without new project Assets = 900,000 Liabilities = 1,000,000 Equity = 0 With new project Assets = 900,000 + 150,000 Liabilities = 1,000,000 Equity = 50,000 Equity holders get 50,000 Debt holders get 1,000,000 Equity holders get nothing Debt holders get 900,000 14 Debt overhang & Under-investment • Shareholders have no incentives in making this new investment • Debt overhang: A situation in which equity holders choose not to invest in a positive NPV project because the value of undertaking the investment opportunity will accrue to bondholders rather than themselves 15 Cashing out • When a firm faces financial distress, shareholders have an incentive to withdraw money from the firm, if possible • E.g., if it is likely the company will default, the firm may sell assets below market value and use the funds to pay an immediate cash dividend to the shareholders • This is another form of under-investment that occurs when a firm faces financial distress 16 Contract design • Contract design can be used to align the managerial incentives with the interests of business owners in order to mitigate agency costs • The first major insights were derived in the context of employment contracts involving risk-averse agents (employees) whose actions could not be directly observed by the principal (employer) • Instead, the principal could only imperfectly observe a measure of the agent’s performance 17 Basic principal-agent model – some definitions • Rewards = outcomes that people care about (both financial and non- financial rewards) • Effort = actions that people won’t take without rewards (not just hours worked) • Incentives = links between rewards and effort (not just compensation contract) • E.g., compensation sensitive to performance, concern about future labour market outcomes 18 Basic principal-agent model – setup • 2 individuals: principal and agent • The role of the principal is to supply capital, bear risk, and design an incentive scheme (a contract) for the agent • The principal can be thought of as a “representative shareholder” or the board of directors • The role of the agent is to exert effort in order to make sound managerial decisions on behalf of the principal 19 The technology of production • The agent’s contribution to firm value (𝑥) • Change in shareholders’ wealth • The action (effort) the agent takes to produce output (𝑎) • Other exogenous factors that are beyond the agent’s control (𝜀). For simplicity, assume 𝐸 𝜀 = 0 • The production function: 𝑥 = 𝑎 + 𝜀 20 Contract • The agent’s total compensation for the period of the contract, denoted by w, is a linear function of output: 𝑤 = 𝑠 + 𝑏 × 𝑥 • In such a contract, s can be viewed as salary and b as the agent’s bonus rate 21 Payoffs • The principal’s payoff (or “profit”): 𝜋 = 𝑥 − 𝑤 For simplicity, we assume the principal is risk neutral • The agent’s payoff (or “utility”): 𝑈 = 𝑤 − 𝑐(𝑎) where c(a) is the dollar amount necessary to compensate the agent for taking a particular action, a For simplicity, the agent is risk-averse 22 Sequence of events 1. The Principal and the Agent sign a compensation contract 2. The Agent chooses an action (𝑎) which could be either low effort (aL) or high effort (aH) (in most cases, the Principal cannot observe this choice) 3. Events beyond the Agent’s control (𝜀) occur 4. Together, the action and the noise determine the Agent’s output (𝑥) 5. Output is observed by the Principal and the Agent: 𝑥𝑆(success) or 𝑥𝐹 (failure) 6. The Agent receives the compensation specified by the contract 23 Unobservable effort • The principal can base the contract on performance only (not on effort) What should be the optimal contract? 24 Effort/Performance 𝑥𝑆 (success) 𝑥𝐹 (failure) 𝑎𝐻 𝑃𝐻 1 − 𝑃𝐻 𝑎𝐿 𝑃𝐿 1 − 𝑃𝐿 Optimal contract • Maximize the Principal’s expected payoff: 𝑃𝐻 𝑥𝑆 − 𝑤𝑆 + (1 − 𝑃𝐻)(𝑥𝐹 − 𝑤𝐹) s.t.: • Incentive compatibility constraint (IC) (the agent should be compensated so they prefer to exert high effort) 𝑃𝐻𝑢 𝑤𝑆 + 1 − 𝑃𝐻 𝑢 𝑤𝐹 − 𝑐(𝑎𝐻) ≥ 𝑃𝐿𝑢 𝑤𝑆 + 1 − 𝑃𝐿 𝑢 𝑤𝐹 − 𝑐(𝑎𝐿) • Individual rationality constraints (IR) (the contract should be attractive to the agent) 𝑃𝐻𝑢 𝑤𝑆 + 1 − 𝑃𝐻 𝑢 𝑤𝐹 − 𝑐(𝑎𝐻) ≥ ത𝑈 where ത𝑈 is the Agent’s reservation utility (opportunity cost, e.g., outside offer) 25 Optimization with inequality constraints Max 𝑓 𝑥 s.t.: 𝑔𝑗 𝑥 ≤ 𝑐𝑗 for j = 1, 2, …, m The Lagrange function is: 𝐿 𝑥 = 𝑓 𝑥 − ෍ 𝑗=1 𝑚 𝜆𝑗 𝑔𝑗 𝑥 − 𝑐𝑗 Kuhn-Tucker (KT) conditions: 𝐿𝑖 ′ 𝑥 = 0 for i = 1, 2, …, m 𝜆𝑗 ≥ 0; 𝑔𝑗 𝑥 ≤ 𝑐𝑗 and 𝜆𝑗 𝑔𝑗 𝑥 − 𝑐𝑗 = 0 for j = 1, 2, …, m 26 Complementary slackness conditions An (inequality) constraint is binding if 𝑔𝑗 𝑥 = 𝑐𝑗 The KT conditions are both necessary and sufficient if • The objective function is concave AND Either (1) each constraint is linear (i.e., each constraint is binding) Or (2) each constraint function is convex, and some vectors of the variables satisfy all constraints strictly In other words, we have to check for solutions when 𝝀𝒋 > 𝟎 and when 𝝀𝒋 = 𝟎 for all j! 27 Example Max −(𝑥 − 4)2 −(𝑦 − 4)2 s.t.: 𝑥 + 𝑦 ≤ 4 𝑥 + 3𝑦 ≤ 9 28 Solution (1) The Lagrange function is: −(𝑥 − 4)2 −(𝑦 − 4)2 −𝜆1(𝑥 + 𝑦 − 4) − 𝜆2(𝑥 + 3𝑦 − 9) KT conditions: −2𝑥 + 8 − 𝜆1 − 𝜆2 = 0 −2𝑦 + 8 − 𝜆1 − 3𝜆2 = 0 𝜆1 𝑥 + 𝑦 − 4 = 0 𝜆2 𝑥 + 3𝑦 − 9 = 0 𝑥 + 𝑦 ≤ 4 𝑥 + 3𝑦 ≤ 9 𝜆1; 𝜆2 ≥ 0 29 Solution (2) If 𝜆1 = 0; 𝜆2 = 0 (both constraints are not binding): −2𝑥 + 8 = 0 (1) −2𝑦 + 8 = 0 (2) 𝑥 + 𝑦 < 4 (3) 𝑥 + 3𝑦 < 9 (4) From (1) and (2): 𝑥 = 𝑦 = 2 Do not satisfy (3) 30 Solution (3) If 𝜆1 = 0; 𝜆2 > 0 (the 1st constraint is not binding): −2𝑥 + 8 − 𝜆2 = 0 (1) −2𝑦 + 8 − 3𝜆2 = 0 (2) 𝑥 + 𝑦 < 4 (3) 𝑥 + 3𝑦 = 9 (4) From (1) and (2): 𝑦 = 3𝑥 − 8 Combined with (3): 𝑥 = 3.3; 𝑦 = 1.9 do not satisfy (3) 31 Solution (4) If 𝜆1 > 0; 𝜆2 = 0 (the 2nd constraint is not binding): −2𝑥 + 8 − 𝜆1 = 0 (1) −2𝑦 + 8 − 𝜆1 = 0 (2) 𝑥 + 𝑦 = 4 (3) 𝑥 + 3𝑦 < 9 (4) From (1) and (2): 𝑥 = 𝑦 Combined with (3): 𝑥 = 𝑦 = 2 This is a solution 32 Solution (5) If 𝜆1 > 0; 𝜆2 > 0 (both constraints are binding): −2𝑥 + 8 − 𝜆1 − 𝜆2 = 0 (1) −2𝑦 + 8 − 𝜆1 − 3𝜆2 = 0 (2) 𝑥 + 𝑦 = 4 (3) 𝑥 + 3𝑦 = 9 (4) From (3) and (4): 𝑥 = 1.5; 𝑦 = 2.5 Combined with (1) and (2): 𝜆2 = −1 does not satisfy 𝜆2 > 0 3334 Is higher compensation necessary good for firms? Things to consider: • Moral hazard • Unequal pay • Stakeholders 35 Executives vs. typical workers (Financial Times 2017; 2022) CEOs vs. other executives Female vs. male executives (CNBC 2021) Corporate Social Responsibility • ESG scoring • Shareholders vs stakeholders podcasts Quiz 1 The Board of Directors of Baxter, Inc. are designing an employment contract for the company’s new CEO. The CEO can exert either a high effort 𝑎𝐻 (the equivalent monetary value is 1) or a low effort 𝑎𝐿 (the equivalent monetary value is 0) in managing the company. The Board of Directors are expecting that effort will have an impact on the company’s earnings in the way given in the table below. They also know that the CEO has also offers from other companies providing her with a satisfaction level ഥ𝑈 = 2.

Finding the best way to do something under constraints is called a constrained optimisation problem 1 A typical constrained optimisation problem could be either a maximisation problem or a minimisation problem. A constrained maximisation problem can be represented as follows: max f (x) s.t. gi (x) ≤ 0, i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m} hj (x) = 0, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , t} (1) Here, f is called the objective function. gi (x) is called an inequality constrained function • When an inequality constraint holds with equality (gi (x) = 0), it is said to be binding. hj (x) is called an equality constrained function. 2 A minimisation problem can be written as: min f (x) s.t. gi (x) ≤ 0, i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m} hj (x) = 0, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , t} (2) 3 The feasible region We call a point x a feasible solution if it satisﬁes the constraints: gi (x) ≤ 0, i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m} hj (x) = 0, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , t} Let F denote the set of all feasible solutions. • It is called the feasible set or the feasible region. 4 Maximisation The maximisation problem (1) is to ﬁnd some feasible solution x ∗ ∈ F such that f (x ∗) ≥ f (x) for all x ∈ F . • We’ve already encountered such problems when covering linear programming. • The diﬀerence now is that f , gi and hj need not be linear functions. 5 The Lagrange function A powerful method for solving constrained optimisation problems is to transform the maximisation or minimisation problem into a Lagrange function and then solve a system of equations. • The Lagrangian for the maximisation problem is given by: L(x, λ1, · · · , λm, µ1, · · · , µt) = f (x)− m∑ i=1 λi gi (x)− t∑ j=1 µj hj (x) • The Lagrangian for the minimisation problem is given by: L(x, λ, µ) = f (x) + m∑ i=1 λi gi (x) + t∑ j=1 µj hj (x) 6 The Kuhn-Tucker condition Step 1. Write down the following system of equations and inequalities, called the Kuhn-Tucker condition: ∇x L(x, λ, µ) = 0 gi (x) ≤ 0 i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m} hj (x) = 0 j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , t} λi gi (x) = 0 i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m} λi ≥ 0 i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m} (3) For example, for the maximisation problem we have: ∇x L(x, λ, µ) = ∇f (x) − m∑ i=1 λi ∇gi (x) − t∑ j=1 µj ∇hj (x) = 0 7 The complementary slackness condition Step 1. Solve the following system of equations, called the Kuhn-Tucker condition: ∇x L(x, λ, µ) = 0 gi (x) ≤ 0 i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m} hj (x) = 0 j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , t} λi gi (x) = 0 i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m} λi ≥ 0 i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m} (3) We call λi gi (x) = 0 the complementary slackness condition. • It implies that whenever inequality constraint i is not binding (gi (x) < 0), we must have λi = 0. 8 Kuhn-Tucker method, continued Step 2. Find all feasible solutions x to the equations and inequalities in (3). We may not know which inequality constraints will be binding. • Many of them may be binding, or none of them. • We therefore need to check for solutions where λi > 0 and where λi = 0 for all i. 9 Kuhn-Tucker method, continued We may not know which inequality constraints will be binding. • For example, suppose we have two inequality constraints and the following Lagrange function: L(x1, x2, λ1, λ2) = −(x1 − 10) 2 − (x2 − 10)2 + 200 −λ1(x1 + 2x2 − a) − λ2(x1x2 − b) In Step 2, we then need to check the following cases for feasible solutions: (a) λ1 = λ2 = 0 (b) λ1 > 0, λ2 = 0 (c) λ1 = 0, λ2 > 0 (d) λ1 > 0, λ2 > 0 And conﬁrm that they do not violate the constraints. 10 Kuhn-Tucker method, continued Step 3. Evaluate f at all feasible solutions found in Step 2. The feasible solution with the largest function value is usually the solution to the constrained maximisation problem. • I have uploaded some necessary and suﬃcient conditions on VLE. • On the exam, I will not give you constrained optimisation problems where this method does not work. ◦ Just be aware that there are various necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the method to produce a valid solution. 11 Example 1 Suppose a consumer has the utility function u(x1, x2) = x 1/3 1 x 2/3 2 , where x1 and x2 denote the quantities consumed of two goods. Suppose the consumer has a budget of B > 0. The prices of the two goods are p1 > 0 and p2 > 0. Find the optimal consumption levels of the goods for the consumer under his/her budget constraint. 12 Example 1 The problem can be written as: max u(x1, x2) = x 1/3 1 x 2/3 2 s.t. p1x1 + p2x2 ≤ B 13 Example 1 Rewrite it as: max u(x1, x2) = x 1/3 1 x 2/3 2 s.t. p1x1 + p2x2 − B ≤ 0 Its corresponding Lagrange function is: L(x1, x2, λ) = x 1/3 1 x 2/3 2 − λ(p1x1 + p2x2 − B) Its Kuhn-Tucker condition is: ∇x1,x2L(x1, x2, λ) = ∇u(x1, x2) − λ∇g (x1, x2) = 0 p1x1 + p2x2 − B ≤ 0 λ(p1x1 + p2x2 − B) = 0 λ ≥ 0 14 Example 1 Rewrite it as: max u(x1, x2) = x 1/3 1 x 2/3 2 s.t. p1x1 + p2x2 − B ≤ 0 Its corresponding Lagrange function is: L(x1, x2, λ) = x 1/3 1 x 2/3 2 − λ(p1x1 + p2x2 − B) Its Kuhn-Tucker condition is: ∇x1,x2L(x1, x2, λ) =    1 3 x −2/3 1 x 2/3 2 2 3 x 1/3 1 x −1/3 2  |  − λ ( p1 p2 ) = ( 0 0 ) p1x1 + p2x2 − B ≤ 0 λ(p1x1 + p2x2 − B) = 0 λ ≥ 0 15 Example 1 Or, equivalently, its Kuhn-Tucker condition is: 1 3 x −2/3 1 x 2/3 2 − λp1 = 0 2 3 x 1/3 1 x −1/3 2 − λp2 = 0 p1x1 + p2x2 − B ≤ 0 λ(p1x1 + p2x2 − B) = 0 λ ≥ 0 • Observe that since p1 > 0, p2 > 0 and B > 0, there exist x1 > 0 and x2 > 0 such that p1x1 + p2x2 − B ≤ 0. • Also, for any x1 > 0 and x2 > 0 satisfying p1x1 + p2x2 − B ≤ 0, we have u(x1, x2) > u(0, x2) = u(x1, 0) = 0. =⇒ The solution (x1, x2) to the problem must be x1 > 0 and x2 > 0. 16 Example 1 It then follows from 1 3 x −2/3 1 x 2/3 2 − λp1 = 0 that λ > 0. This means we can ignore the λ = 0 case. From λ(p1x1 + p2x2 − B) = 0 we then know that p1x1 + p2x2 − B = 0. • I.e., when λ > 0, the budget constraint is binding. 17 Example 1 Solving the equations 1 3 x −2/3 1 x 2/3 2 = λp1 2 3 x 1/3 1 x −1/3 2 = λp2 for x2 yields x2 = 2x1p1 p2 . Substituting x2 = 2x1p1 p2 into p1x1 + p2x2 = B gives the optimal consumption: x ∗ 1 = B 3p1 x ∗ 2 = 2B 3p2 18 Lagrange multipliers λ is called a Lagrange multiplier. • If we have multiple constraints, all λi s and µj s are called Lagrange multipliers. L(x, λ) = x 1/3 1 x 2/3 2 − λ(p1x1 + p2x2 − B) ∇x L(x, λ) = ∇u(x) − λ∇g (x) = 0 19 Lagrange multipliers λ is called a Lagrange multiplier. • If we have multiple constraints, all λi s and µj s are called Lagrange multipliers. L(x, λ) = x 1/3 1 x 2/3 2 − λ(p1x1 + p2x2 − B) ∇x L(x, λ) = ∇u(x) − λ∇g (x) = 0 ∇u(x) = λ∇g (x) I.e., the gradient of the objective function u is proportional to the gradient of g (our constraint). • λ is the proportionality constant. 20 Lagrange multipliers ∇u(x) = λ∇g (x) ∇L(x, λ) = ( 1 3 x −2/3 1 x 2/3 2 2 3 x 1/3 1 x −1/3 2 ) − λ ( p1 p2 ) Here, ∇g (x) is just the price vector. • The price vector determines how much more we can consume of each good if we relax the constraint (by increasing B). λ reﬂects the diﬀerence between how much the utility increases when we increase consumption slightly (∇u(x)) and how much we can increase consumption when the constraint is relaxed (∇g (x)). • It is the marginal utility of relaxing the constraint, called the shadow price. 21 Lagrange multipliers In general, Lagrange multipliers measure how much the value of the objective function changes as a result of a marginal relaxation of the constraint. • If the constraint is not binding, relaxing the constraint further does not improve the objective value. =⇒ The Lagrange multiplier is 0. 22 Example 2 Solve the following problem: min x 2 1 + x 2 2 s.t. (x1 − 2)2 + (x2 − 1)2 ≤ 1 Solution: Let f (x) = x 2 1 + x 2 2 and g (x) = (x1 − 2)2 + (x2 − 1)2 − 1. We can write the problem into the standard form: min f (x) s.t. g (x) ≤ 0 23 Example 2 The Lagrange function is: L(x, λ) = x 2 1 + x 2 2 + λ((x1 − 2) 2 + (x2 − 1) 2 − 1) The Kuhn-Tucker condition is: ∇x L(x, λ) = ∇f (x) + λ∇g (x) = 0 λ ≥ 0, λ((x1 − 2) 2 + (x2 − 1) 2 − 1) = 0 (x1 − 2) 2 + (x2 − 1) 2 − 1 ≤ 0, where: ∇f (x) = ( 2x1 2x2 ) , ∇g (x) = ( 2x1 − 4 2x2 − 2 ) 24 Example 2 We can rewrite the Kuhn-Tucker condition as: 2x1 + λ(2x1 − 4) = 0 2x2 + λ(2x2 − 2) = 0 λ ≥ 0, λ((x1 − 2)2 + (x2 − 1)2 − 1) = 0 (x1 − 2)2 + (x2 − 1)2 − 1 ≤ 0 The ﬁrst two equations give us: x1 = 2λ 1 + λ x2 = λ 1 + λ We need to consider two cases: λ = 0 and λ > 0. 25 Example 2 L(x, λ) = x 2 1 + x 2 2 + λ((x1 − 2) 2 + (x2 − 1) 2 − 1) Case 1 (λ = 0). By assuming that λ = 0, we assume that the constraint is not binding. • The Lagrange function becomes: L(x, λ) = f (x) = x 2 1 + x 2 2 The ﬁrst expression in the Kuhn-Tucker condition becomes: ∇x L(x, λ) = ∇f (x) = 0 I.e., in Case 1, we are just looking for stationary points! • Same as in the unconstrained optimisation case. 26 Example 2 x1 = 2λ 1 + λ x2 = λ 1 + λ Case 1 (λ = 0). Inserting λ = 0 gives us x1 = x2 = 0. • This violates the constraint (x1 − 2)2 + (x2 − 1)2 − 1 ≤ 0, since 4 ̸≤ 0. =⇒ Case 1 can be disregarded. 27 Example 2 Case 2 (λ > 0). As before, we have: x1 = 2λ 1 + λ x2 = λ 1 + λ It follows from λ((x1 − 2)2 + (x2 − 1)2 − 1) = 0 that: (x1 − 2) 2 + (x2 − 1) 2 = 1 I.e., the constraint is binding. 28 Example 2 Plug x1 = 2λ 1 + λ and x2 = λ 1 + λ into (x1 − 2)2 + (x2 − 1)2 = 1. • This yields λ2 + 2λ − 4 = 0, which has two roots: λA = −1 − √5 < 0 λB = −1 + √5 > 0 29 Example 2 x1 = 2λ 1 + λ x2 = λ 1 + λ λA = −1 − √5 < 0 λB = −1 + √5 > 0 λA < 0 contradicts the assumtion λ ≥ 0. • So we have λ∗ = λB = √5 − 1 and the minimum point: x ∗ 1 = 2√ 5 − 2 √5 x ∗ 2 = √5 − 1 √5 The minimum value is: f (x ∗) = 6 − 2√ 5 30 Example 2 • The ﬁrst expression of the Kuhn-Tucker condition is: ∇x L(x, λ) = ∇f (x) + λ∇g (x) = 0, or −∇f (x) = λ∇g (x) Since λ∗ > 0, we have found a point where: (a) The constraint is binding. (b) The gradient of f is proportional to the gradient of g , and pointing in the opposite direction. • The level sets of f and g will be tangent when the gradients are proportional, since they are perpendicular to the gradients. This is where the sign in front of λ matters. There is a point where the constraint is binding while f (x) and ∇g (x) point in the same direction. 31 Minimisation and maximisation Consider the constrained minimisation problem: min f (x) s.t. gi (x) ≤ 0, i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m} hj (x) = 0, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , t} (4) Any minimisation problem can be reformulated as a maximisation problem and vice versa. 32 Minimisation and maximisation Lemma 1 The following two problems have the same optimal solutions: max x∈F f (x), min x∈F −f (x) Proof. Let x ∗ ∈ F be an optimal solution to maxx∈F f (x). Then we have: f (x ∗) ≥ f (x) for all x ∈ F Equivalently: −f (x ∗) ≤ −f (x) for all x ∈ F This means that x ∗ is also an optimal solution to minx∈F −f (x). 33 Readings Study Chapters 13 and 14 in Essential Mathematics for Economic Analysis. 34 Week 4 Financial Statement Analysis and Discounted Cash Flow Valuation 1 Lecture outline • Annual report • Financial statement analysis • Time value of money • Discounted cash flow valuation 2 Learning outcomes • Gain a basic understanding of a firm’s annual report • Be able to perform financial statement analysis and use financial statement information • Understand time value of money • Be able to evaluate a project/investment based on discounted cash flow evaluation 3 Source: tesla.com 4 An annual report contains • The statement of financial positions (balance sheet) • The income statement • The statement of cash flows 5 Balance sheet (1) Current assets (e.g., cash, stock inventory) Non-current assets: • Tangible non-current assets (e.g., land, buildings, plants) • Intangible non-current assets (e.g., trademarks, patents, copyrights) Current liabilities (e.g., short-term debts) Non-current liabilities (e.g., long-term debts) Equity 6 Balance sheet (2) • 3 important considerations: • Liquidity • Debt vs. equity • Value vs. cost 7 Income statement (1) Summarizes performance over a specific period Revenue - Expenses  Income 8 Income statement (2) • 3 important considerations: • Non-cash items: expenses charged against revenues that do not directly affect cash flow (e.g., depreciation) • Time • Costs 9 Statement of cash flows (1) CF from assets CF from creditors CF from shareholders Total CF CF from operating activities: cash generated from normal business activities CF from investing activities: cash generated or expended from long-term investments CF from financing activities: cash raised from investors 10 Statement of cash flows (2) • 3 important considerations: • Operating cash flows • Cash flow is NOT the same as profit • Free cash flow: cash flow available after all taxes have been paid and after all positive net present value projects have been financed 11 Financial statement analysis • Ratio analysis • The Du Pont Identity • Choose a Benchmark 12 Short-term solvency ratios (liquidity ratios) • Determine the firm’s ability to pay its bills over the short run without undue stress 𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 = 𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠 𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠 𝑄𝑢𝑖𝑐𝑘 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 𝐴𝑐𝑖𝑑 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 = 𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠 − 𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦 𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠 𝐶𝑎𝑠ℎ 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 = 𝐶𝑎𝑠ℎ 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑐𝑎𝑠ℎ 𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠 13 >1: the firm can meet its immediate financial obligations Some of inventories might be damaged/lost; large inventories = short-term trouble >1: the firm has more cash than it needs to pay off the current debts.

This will generally have the effect of maintaining the break-even point (however measured) at its minimum level 25 Capital rationing • Capital rationing refers to the situation that exists if a firm has positive-NPV projects but cannot find the necessary financing • Soft rationing refers to the situation that occurs when units in a business are allocated a certain amount of financing for capital budgeting • Hard rationing refers to the situation that occurs when a business cannot raise financing for a project under any circumstances 26 Example Consider the following investment opportunities: The required rate of return is 12%. What would be the investment decision if there is no capital rationing? How would the decision change if the firm applies capital rationing by restricting the total fund for investments to £20 mil? 27 Project Cash flows (£mil) Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 A -20 70 10 B -10 15 40 C -10 -5 60No capital rationing: invest in all 3 projects 28 Project Cash flows (£mil) NPV Rank (NPV) Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 A -20 70 10 50.47 1 B -10 15 40 35.28 2 C -10 -5 60 33.37 3 With capital rationing: If we rely on NPV to decide, we have to forgo B and C (i.e., invest in A only) 29 Project Cash flows (£mil) NPV Rank (NPV) Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 A -20 70 10 50.47 1 B -10 15 40 35.28 2 C -10 -5 60 33.37 3 With capital rationing: If we rely on PI to decide, we should invest in B and C (i.e., forgo A) 30 Project Cash flows (£mil) NPV Rank (NPV) PI Rank (PI) Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 A -20 70 10 50.47 1 3.52 3 B -10 15 40 35.28 2 4.53 1 C -10 -5 60 33.37 3 4.34 2 Advantages of capital rationing • Ensure a budget is followed • Optimal utilization of resources • More effective and efficient project management 31 Disadvantages of capital rationing • Applying capital rationing = focusing on short-term rather than long- term growth 32 Weeks 7&8 Capital structure policy 1 Lecture outline • Cost of capital: the basics • Raising capital • Capital structure • The Modigliani-Miller (M&M) propositions • Static theory • Pecking order theory 2 Learning outcomes • Be able to understand the key differences between debt financing and equity financing • Be able to understand the M&M propositions with/without taxes, with/without bankruptcy costs • Gain a basic understanding of the static theory and pecking order theory and applying them in choosing capital structure 3 Basic concepts • A firm can raise funds by issuing both debt and equity securities - this mix is known as the capital structure • How should the financial manager choose the right combination between debt and equity to maximize the firm value? • Is equity better than debt, or vice versa? 4 Cost of capital • Cost of equity: the return that equity investors require on their investment in the firm • Ordinary equity: equity without priority for dividends or in bankruptcy • Preference shares: equity with dividend priority over ordinary shares, normally with a fixed dividend rate, sometimes without voting rights • Cost of debt: the return that lenders require on the firm’s debt • Borrowing from banks • Issuing corporate bonds 5 Cost of equity: Constant dividend growth approach 𝑅𝐸 = 𝐷1 𝑃0 + 𝑔 where: 𝑅𝐸: Cost of equity 𝐷1: next period’s projected dividend 𝑃0: share price 𝑔: dividend’s constant growth rate 6 Cost of equity: The security market line (SML) approach 𝑅𝐸 = 𝑅𝑓 + 𝛽𝐸 × (𝑅𝑀 − 𝑅𝑓) where: 𝑅𝐸: Cost of equity 𝑅𝑓: risk-free rate (frequently used proxy: returns on short-term government bonds) 𝑅𝑀: expected return on the overall market (frequently used proxy: returns on FTSE 100 index, returns on S&P 500 index) 𝛽𝐸: systematic risk of the equity 7 Cost of preference shares 𝑅𝑃 = 𝐷 𝑃0 where D is the fixed dividend and 𝑃0 is the current preference share price 8 Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) • WACC: the weighted average of the cost of equity and the after-tax cost of debt, also can be interpreted as overall return on assets • If firm does not use preference shares 𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐶 = 𝐸 𝑉 × 𝑅𝐸 + 𝐷 𝑉 × 𝑅𝐷 × (1 − 𝑡𝐶) where E is the market value of equity; D is the market value of debt; V is total market value of debt and equity (V=E+D); 𝑅𝐸 is cost of equity; 𝑅𝐷 is cost of debt; 𝑡𝐶 is tax rate. • If firm uses preference shares 𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐶 = 𝐸 𝑉 × 𝑅𝐸 + 𝑃 𝑉 × 𝑅𝑃 + 𝐷 𝑉 × 𝑅𝐷 × (1 − 𝑡𝐶) 9 You have a brilliant idea for a new financial product targeting the elderlies. Where should you start to create your business? 10 Early-stage financing and venture capital • Go to private equity and venture capital (VC) market • VC: financing for new, often high-risk, ventures • A large amount of private equity investment is undertaken by professional private equity managers representing large institutional investors such as mutual funds and pension funds 11 Stages of financing • Seed money: • A small amount of financing needed to prove a concept or develop a product. Marketing is not included in this stage. • Start-up: • Financing for firms that started within the past year. Funds are likely to pay for marketing and product development expenditures. • Later stage capital: • Additional money to begin sales and manufacturing after a firm has spent its start-up funds. • Growth capital: • Funds earmarked for a firm to enable it to reach its potential and achieve successful growth. • Replacement capital: • Financing for a company to buy out other investors in the firm. • Buyout financing: • Money provided for managers and outside investors to acquire a fully functioning firm. 12 Going public Source: Financial Times (2023) 13 The basic procedure 14 IPO process explained Alternative issue methods 15 The capital structure question Now that your firm is up and running. How should you choose the “right” debt-equity ratio (i.e., the “optimal” capital structure)? • How does financial leverage affect ROE/EPS? • How does financial leverage affect the cost of capital/cost of equity? 16 Debt vs. Equity • Interest is tax deductible → lowers the effective cost of debt • Debt holders are limited to a fixed return → stockholders do not have to share profits if the business does exceptionally well • Debt holders do not have voting rights • Higher debt ratios lead to greater risk and higher required interest rates (to compensate for the additional risk) 17 Maximizing firm value vs. maximizing shareholders’ interests The market value of J. J. Sprint plc is £1,000. The company currently has no debt, and each of J. J. Sprint’s 100 shares sells for £10. Suppose that J. J. Sprint plans to borrow £500 and pay the £500 proceeds to shareholders as an extra cash dividend of £5 per share, which leads to 3 possible outcomes below. In which scenario should the firm restructure? 18 Maximizing firm value vs. maximizing shareholders’ interests 19 Pay-offs to shareholders after restructuring (a) (b) (c) Equity value change (Capital gain) -250 -500 -750 Dividends 500 500 500 Net effect +250 0 -250 • Changes in capital structure benefit the shareholders if and only if the value of the firm increases • Optimal capital structure • maximize firm value • lowest possible WACC Financial leverage and EPS: Example (1) Current Proposed Assets (£) 8,000,000 8,000,000 Debt (£) 0 4,000,000 Equity (£) 8,000,000 4,000,000 Debt-equity ratio 0 1 Share price (£) 20 20 Shares outstanding 400,000 200,000 Interest rate (10%) 10 10 20 Levered firm (use debt) Recession Expected Expansion EBT (£) 500,000 1,000,000 1,500,000 Interest (£) -400,000 -400,000 -400,000 Net income (£) 100,000 600,000 1,100,000 ROE (%) 2.50 15.00 27.50 EPS (£) 0.50 3.00 5.50 Unlevered firm (no debt) Recession Expected Expansion EBT (£) 500,000 1,000,000 1,500,000 Interest (£) 0 0 0 Net income (£) 500,000 1,000,000 1,500,000 ROE (%) 6.25 12.5 18.75 EPS (£) 1.25 2.5 3.75 Financial leverage and EPS: Example (2) 21 Financial leverage magnifies losses and gains Financial leverage and firm value: Example (3) 22 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6EPS EBIT No debt With debtBreak-even point With-debt line is steeper: EPS is more sensitive to changes in EBIT because of financial leverage Advantage to debt Disadvantage to debt What do we learn from the example? • The effect of financial leverage depends on the company’s EBIT • When EBIT is relatively high, leverage is beneficial • Leverage: • magnifies returns (losses) to shareholders relative to no leverage case • Shareholders are exposed to more risk because the EPS and ROE are much more sensitive to changes in EBIT • Because of the impact that financial leverage has on both the expected return to shareholders and the riskiness of the equity, capital structure is an important consideration 23 Does conclusion #4 necessarily follow? • NO 24 Corporate borrowing and homemade leverage (1) Assume you have a chance to invest in the firm discussed in the earlier example and you can choose 1 of the following strategies: • Strategy A: buy 100 shares of the levered equity • Strategy B: • Borrow £2,000 from a bank • Use the borrowed proceeds plus your own investment of £2,000 (a total of £4,000) to buy 200 shares of the current unlevered equity @ £20 per share • Which strategy to you prefer?

• Capital structure seems to be irrelevant because shareholders can adjust the amount of financial leverage by borrowing and lending on their own • Homemade leverage: the use of personal borrowing to change the overall amount of financial leverage to which the individual is exposed 27 Notation D = market value of debt in levered firm E = market value of equity in levered firm VU = value of unlevered firm VL = D + E = value of levered firm EBIT = net operating income before interest and tax rE= return required on equity in levered firm rD = return required on debt in levered firm WACC = weighted average cost of capital tC = rate of corporation tax 28 The Modigliani-Miller (M&M) propositions 29 Assumption: perfect capital market • Investors and firms can trade the same set of securities at competitive market prices equal to the PV of their future cash flows • There are no taxes, transaction costs, or issuance costs associated with security trading • A firm’s financing decisions do not change the cash flows generated by its investments, nor do they reveal new information about them 30 MM1 - Proof (1) • Consider two firms in the same risk class: • one all-equity financed (unlevered) with value VU • the other levered with debt (D) and equity (E) and value VL • Now consider two alternative portfolio strategies: • Investment 1: Buy 10% of shares in unlevered firm U • Investment 2: Buy 10% of equity + 10% of debt of levered firm L 31 MM1 - Proof (2) • Investment 1 • Investment 2 • Investments 1 and 2 offer the same payoff • In a perfect capital market, 2 investments with same payoff (and risk) must have the same initial cost: 0.1VU = 0.1VL → VU = VL Initial cost of investment Expected return 0.1VU 0.1EBIT Initial cost of investment Expected return Debt 0.1D 0.1×rD ×D Equity 0.1E 0.1×(EBIT - rD ×D) Total 0.1(D+E)=0.1VL 0.1EBIT 32 M&M Proposition I • In a perfect capital market, the firm’s value is independent of its capital structure • In other words, the firm’s overall cost of capital, WACC, is NOT affected by the capital structure 33 MM2 - Proof (1) 𝑟𝐸 × 𝐸 𝐷 + 𝐸 + 𝑟𝐷 × 𝐷 𝐷 + 𝐸 = 𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐶 𝐷 + 𝐸 𝐸 × 𝑟𝐸 × 𝐸 𝐷 + 𝐸 + 𝐷 + 𝐸 𝐸 × 𝑟𝐷 × 𝐷 𝐷 + 𝐸 = 𝐷 + 𝐸 𝐸 × 𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐶 𝑟𝐸 + 𝐷 𝐸 × 𝑟𝐷 = 𝐷 + 𝐸 𝐸 × 𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐶 𝑟𝐸 = 𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐶 + 𝐷 𝐸 (𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐶 − 𝑟𝐷) 34 MM2 - Proof (2) • When the firm has only equity: 𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐶 = 𝑟𝑈 (1) • When the firm has both equity and debt: 𝑟𝐸 = 𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐶 + 𝐷 𝐸 𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐶 − 𝑟𝐷 (2) 𝑟𝐸 = 𝑟𝑈 + 𝐷 𝐸 (𝑟𝑈 − 𝑟𝐷) Cost of capital without leverage = Return on assets Additional risk due to leverage 35 According to MM1, WACC is not affected by capital structure, so that WACC in (1) = WACC in (2) M&M Proposition II • The cost of equity increases with the firm’s debt-equity ratio • In other words • The expected rate of return on the common stocks of a levered firm increases with the debt/equity ratio 36 To sum up • In a perfect capital market: • The overall return on firm, or overall return on assets, (WACC) remains constant (i.e., capital structure is irrelevant) • The required return on equity (rE) increases with debt to match the increased risk • This is because increasing debt increases the risk exposure of shareholders (recall they are residual claimants in case of default) • They will require a higher rate of return for this extra risk Implication: In a perfect capital market, any attempt to raise the value of the firm by issuing debt will be exactly offset by the increase in the cost of equity 37 Recap • In a perfect capital market (everyone borrows & lends at the same interest rate, no transaction/bankruptcy costs, no taxes, symmetric information): • Capital structure is irrelevant to shareholders because of homemade leverage. That is, if shareholders prefer a capital structure different from the one chosen by the firm, they can add leverage to their own portfolio to achieve the preferred leverage • Overall cost of capital, WACC, remains constant and is equal to the overall return on assets • Cost of equity increases with the debt-equity ratio 38 What if the market is not perfect? 39 Tax and MM1 (1) 40 Unlevered Levered EBIT 10,000 10,000 D 0 8,000 rD 0 10% Interest paid (rD×D) 0 800 Pre-tax income 10,000 9,200 Tax@35% 3,500 3,220 Net income 6,500 5,980 Unlevered Levered EBIT 10,000 10,000 Tax@35% 3,500 3,220 CF 6,500 6,780 𝐶𝐹𝐿 = 𝐶𝐹𝑈 + 250 250 = 800 × 0.35 = 𝑟𝐷 × 𝐷 × 𝑡𝑎𝑥 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 ⇢ 𝐃𝐞𝐛𝐭 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐭𝐚𝐱 𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐞𝐥𝐝 (𝐃𝐈𝐓𝐒) Tax and MM1 (2) Assume that debt is permanent and constant (i.e., the firm pays a constant interest in perpetuity) 𝑃𝑉 𝐷𝐼𝑇𝑆 = 𝑡𝐶 × 𝑟𝐷 × 𝐷 𝑟𝐷 = 𝑡𝐶 × 𝐷 𝑉𝑈 = 𝐸𝐵𝐼𝑇 × (1 − 𝑡𝐶) 𝑟𝑈 𝑉𝐿 = 𝑉𝑈 + 𝑡𝐶 × 𝐷 𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐶 = 𝐸 𝐷 + 𝐸 × 𝑟𝐸 + (1 − 𝑡𝐶) × 𝐷 𝐷 + 𝐸 × 𝑟𝐷 D increases → the firm’s value increases & WACC decreases 41 Tax and MM2 𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐶 = 𝐸 𝐷 + 𝐸 × 𝑟𝐸 + (1 − 𝑡𝐶) × 𝐷 𝐷 + 𝐸 × 𝑟𝐷 𝑡𝐶 × 𝐷 𝐷+𝐸 × 𝑟𝐷 is the reduction in WACC due to the interest tax shield tC increases → tax advantage of debt increases 𝑟𝐸 = 𝑟𝑈 + (1 − 𝑡𝐶) × (𝑟𝑈−𝑟𝐷) × 𝐷 𝐸 D increases → cost of equity increases 42 Default and bankruptcy in a perfect market • Financial distress: when a firm has difficulty meeting its debt obligations • Default: when a firm fails to make the required interest or principal payments on its debt, or violates a debt covenant • After the firm defaults, debt holders are given certain rights to the assets of the firm and may even take legal ownership of the firm’s assets through bankruptcy An important consequence of leverage is the risk of bankruptcy Equity financing does not carry this risk 43 Bankruptcy and capital structure • With perfect capital markets: • The risk of bankruptcy is not a disadvantage of debt • Bankruptcy simply shifts the ownership of the firm from equity holders to debt holders without changing the total value available to all investors • In reality: • Bankruptcy is often a long and complicated process that imposes both direct and indirect costs on the firm and its investors 44 Direct costs of bankruptcy • The bankruptcy process is complex, time-consuming, and costly • Costly outside experts are often hired by the firm to assist with the bankruptcy process • Creditors also incur costs during the bankruptcy process • They may wait several years to receive payment • They may hire their own experts for legal and professional advice The direct costs of bankruptcy reduce the value of assets that the firm’s investors will ultimately receive 45 Indirect costs of bankruptcy • While the indirect costs are difficult to measure accurately, they are often much larger than the direct costs of bankruptcy • Loss of customers • Loss of suppliers • Loss of employees • Fire sale of assets • etc Sources: Reuters (2020); The New York Times (2020) 46 Static theory of capital structure • At relatively low debt levels, the probability of bankruptcy and financial distress is low, and the (tax shield) benefit from debt outweighs the cost • At very high debt levels, the possibility of financial distress is a chronic, ongoing problem for the firm, so the benefit from debt financing may be more than offset by the financial distress costs => Static theory of capital structure: a firm borrows up to the point where the tax benefit from an extra pound or euro in debt is exactly equal to the cost that comes from the increased probability of financial distress 4748 Firm value, V Debt, D MM, no tax 𝑉𝑈 MM, with tax 𝑉𝐿 PV of tax shield PV of financial distress costs Static theory 𝑉 𝐷∗ 𝑉∗ 49 Cost of capital, WACC Debt-equity ratio, D/E MM, no tax 𝑟𝑈 MM, with tax Static theory 𝐷∗/𝐸∗ 𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐶∗ In reality, many large, financially sophisticated and highly profitable firms use little debt.

Explain. Week 9 Dividends and payout policy 1 Lecture outline • Cash dividends • Does dividend policy matter? • Real-world factors • Share repurchases • Stock dividends and stock splits 2 Learning outcomes • Be able to understand the basics of different dividends and payout policies • Be able to understand the factors that affect dividend policy • Be able to understand and analyse the effects of dividend policy/dividend announcement on stock price 3 Dividend: a payment made out of a firm’s earnings to its owners, in the form of either cash or stock 4 Cash dividends • Regular cash dividends • A cash payment made by a firm to its owners in the normal course of business • Extra dividends • May or may not be repeated in the future • Special dividends • Truly unusual/one-time event, won’t be repeated • Liquidating dividends • Some or all of the business has been sold off 5 Standard Method of Cash Dividend Payment Declaration date • the date on which the board of directors passes a resolution to pay a dividend Ex-dividend date • the date two business days before the date of record, establishing those individuals entitled to a dividend Date of record • the date by which a holder must be on record to be designated to receive a dividend Date of payment • the date on which the dividend is paid 6 Price behaviour around the ex-dividend date (1) • Suppose we have an equity that sells for £10 per share. The board of directors declares a dividend of £1 per share, and the record date is set to be Tuesday 12 June. The ex-date will be 2 business (not calendar) days earlier, on Friday 8 June. • If you buy the equity on Thursday 7 June, just as the market closes, you’ll get the £1 dividend, because the equity is trading cum dividend. • If you wait and buy it just as the market opens on Friday, you won’t get the £1 dividend. What happens to the value of the equity overnight? 7 With dividend Price behaviour around the ex-dividend date (2) • We would expect that the share price will go down by about the dividend amount when the equity goes ex-dividend • Determining the value of the actual price drop is complicated because of the different tax rates and tax rules that apply for different buyers 89 Dividend vs dividend policy • Dividend policy • Time pattern of dividend payout • Should the firm pay out a large dividend now or a small (or even zero) dividend? • Dividend = cash matters • Investors prefer higher dividends to lower dividends at any single date if the dividend level is held constant at every other date • If the dividend per share at a given date is raised while the dividend per share at every other date is held constant, the share price will rise • How’s about dividend policy? 10 Case study (1) Bristol is an all-equity firm that has existed for 10 years. The current financial managers plan to dissolve the firm in 2 years. The total cash flows the firm will generate, including the proceeds from liquidation, will be £10,000 in each of the next 2 years. 11 Case study (2) Current Policy: Dividends Set Equal to Cash Flow At present, dividends at each date are set equal to the cash flow of £10,000. There are 100 shares outstanding and the required rate of return is 10%. 𝑃0 = 𝐷1 1 + 𝑟 + 𝐷2 (1 + 𝑟)2 = 100 1.1 + 100 1.12 = £173.55 The firm is worth 100 × £173.55 = £17,355 Several members of the board of Bristol have expressed dissatisfaction with the current dividend policy and have asked you to analyse an alternative policy. 12 Case study (3) Another possible policy is for the firm to pay a dividend of £110 per share on the first date (Date 1), which makes a total dividend of £11,000. Because the cash flow is only £10,000, an extra £1,000 must somehow be raised. Assume that equity is issued. The new shareholders will desire enough cash flow at Date 2 that they earn the required 10% return on their Date 1 investment. This means the new shareholders will get the Date 2 CF of £1,000×1.1 = £1,100, leaving £8,900 to be distributed to the old shareholders. 𝑃0 = 𝐷1 1 + 𝑟 + 𝐷2 (1 + 𝑟)2 = 110 1.1 + 89 1.12 = £173.55 13 The irrelevance of dividend policy • The previous results suggest that dividend policy might not be matter to the firm value • Explanations: • Any increase in a dividend at some point in time is exactly offset by a decrease somewhere else, so the net effect, once we account for time value, is zero. • Shareholders can alter the firm’s dividend policy to suit themselves • Homemade dividend policy: the tailored dividend policy created by individual investors who undo corporate dividend policy by reinvesting dividends or selling shares of equity 14 In reality, there are several factors that could affect the irrelevance of dividend policy 15 Real world factors favouring a low dividend policy • Taxes • Effective tax rates on dividend income are different from tax rates on capital gains • Flotation costs • Selling new equity can be expensive • Dividend restrictions • A corporation may face restrictions on its ability to pay dividends. E.g., a corporation may be prohibited by law from paying dividends if the dividend amount exceeds the firm’s retained earnings. 16 Real world factors favouring a high dividend policy • Desire for current income • Information content of dividends and dividend signalling • Agency costs • Behavioural finance • Managers have superior information about firms’ performance • Announcement of an increase in dividends gives a good signal about future earnings and cash flows • It also signals that the firm won’t be hoarding cash, thus, reducing agency costs and enhancing shareholder wealth E.g.: Firms pay dividends because investors exercise better self-control with their spendings if they get a “check in the mail” in the form of a dividend (Shefrin and Statman, 1984) 17 The clientele effect • Different investors prefer different dividend policies • Tax-free or low-tax paying investors prefer high dividends • High-tax paying investors prefer low dividends or no dividends • Firms’ dividend policy is optimized for the tax preference of its investor clientele • Dynamic clientele effect (dividend-capture theory): • Ignoring transaction costs, investors can trade shares at the time of the dividend so that non-taxed investors receive the dividend. That is, non-taxed investors need not hold the high-dividend-paying stocks all the time, it is necessary only that they hold them when the dividend is actually paid 18 0 50000000 100000000 150000000 200000000 250000000 03/05/2004 03/06/2004 03/07/2004 03/08/2004 03/09/2004 03/10/2004 03/11/2004 03/12/2004 Microsoft Volume 19 Announcement of special dividend ($3) Ex-dividend date Low-tax investors buy the stock in anticipation of the dividend and then reverse those trades afterwardsThe catering theory of dividends • Baker and Wurgler (Journal of Finance, 2004): • The decision to pay dividends is driven by prevailing investor demand for dividend payers • Managers (rationally) cater to investors by paying dividends when investors put a stock price premium on payers, and by not paying when investors prefer nonpayers 20 Share repurchases • Share repurchase (buyback): the purchase, by a corporation, of its own shares of equity • Firms buy their own equity from open market • Tender offer • Firms buy shares from specific individual shareholders (targeted purchase) 21 Most common in US The firm announces the intention to all shareholders to repurchase a fixed number of shares for a fixed price, conditional on shareholders agreeing to tender their shares. If not enough shares are tendered, the deal can be cancelled Similar to tender offer but only targeted shareholders can tender their shares Cash dividends vs Repurchases: Conceptual example (1) Telephonic Industries has excess cash of £300,000 (or £3 per share) and is considering an immediate payment of this amount as an extra dividend. The firm forecasts that, after the dividend, earnings will be £450,000 per year, or £4.50 for each of the 100,000 shares outstanding. The price–earnings ratio is 6 for comparable companies. Alternatively, the firm could use the excess cash to repurchase some of its own equity. Imagine that a tender offer of £30 a share is made. 22 Cash dividends vs Repurchases: Conceptual example (2) • Cash dividends: • Share price after dividend is paid = £27 (= £4.50  6) • With dividends, each (existing) shareholder owns a share worth £27 and receives £3 in dividends, making the total value of £30 • Repurchase: • Repurchased shares = 10,000 (= £300,000/£30) • Remaining shares = 90,000 (= 100,000-10,000) • Earnings per (remaining) shares = £5 (= £450,000/90,000) • Share price after the repurchase is £30 (= £5  6) 23 “Improvement” in EPS Dividends vs Repurchases: Real world considerations • Flexibility: • Firms often view dividends as a commitment to their stockholders and are quite hesitant to reduce an existing dividend. Repurchases do not represent a similar commitment. • Executive compensation: • Executives are frequently given stock options as part of their overall compensation. They would prefer a repurchase to a dividend because the stock price will be greater after a repurchase than after a dividend. • Undervaluation • Firms might buy back stock when they believe that the stock price is temporarily depressed. • Taxes • Repurchases provide a tax advantage over dividends. 24 Pros and cons of paying dividends Pros Cons • Cash dividends can underscore good results and provide support for the share price. • Dividends may attract institutional investors who prefer some return in the form of dividends. A mix of institutional and individual investors may allow a firm to raise capital at a lower cost because of the ability of the firm to reach a wider market. • Share prices usually increase with the announcement of a new or increased dividend. • Dividends absorb excess cash flow and may reduce the agency costs that arise from conflicts between management and shareholders. • Dividends are taxed. • Dividends can reduce internal sources of financing. Dividends may force the firm to forgo positive-NPV projects (which, of course, firms SHOULD NOT do) or rely on costly external equity financing. • Once dividends are established, dividend cuts are hard to make without adversely affecting a firm’s share price. 25 Dividend policies in reality • In Europe: • Aggregate dividends paid are quite large • But the total real dividends (share repurchases + cash dividends) were decreasing • Percentage of firms paying dividends has also declined • Dividend smoothing • Dividend-paying firms tend to raise dividends only after earnings have risen (i.e., dividend growth lags earnings growth) • Firms don’t increase or cut dividends in response to temporary earning fluctuations (i.e., dividend growth tends to be smoother than earnings growth) 26 Stock dividends and stock splits • Stock dividend: a payment made by a firm to its owners in the form of equity, diluting the value of each share outstanding • A 20% stock dividend means that a shareholder receives one new share for every five currently owned • Changes the composition of equity accounts (a portion of retained earnings is transferred to paid-in capital but the total stockholders’ equity remains the same) • Stock split: an increase in a firm’s shares outstanding without any change in owners’ equity • A three-for-one stock split means each old share is split into three new shares • Does not have any effect on total paid-in capital, retained earnings, and total stockholders’ equity • Reverse split: a stock split in which a firm’s number of shares outstanding is reduced 27","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
