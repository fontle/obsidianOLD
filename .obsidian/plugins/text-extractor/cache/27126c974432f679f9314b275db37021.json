Name of Publisher: Palgrave 4 The Role of Imperfect Competition in New Keynesian Economics INTRODUCTION The adjective 'new Keynesian' was introduced in the lllid-1980s and refers to a body of work which was published over a period beginning in the mid-1970s. Whilst the term clearly applies 10papers written sinceIYXO. it has also been applied retrospectively 10some work written before. that. Much of this material is gathered together in a two-volume collection of reprinted papers edited by Mankiw and Romer (1991). allhough the coverage of this volume is somewhat parochial in that only American-based authors are included. There arc other more recent surveys, most notably Silvestre (1993) and Dixon and Rankin (1994).1 In order to understand the phenomenon of new Keynesian macroeconomics, it is essential to set it in an historical context. 2 WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT? The epithet 'new' has been used many times in economics, particularly in recent times. Thus. for example. the 'new' industrial economics; the 'new' trade theory; the 'new' economic geography; are all labels that have come into usc since 1980. In these cases the adjective 'new' designates some degree of a break with the 'old', but also some degree of continuity. For example. the 'new' in the new industrial economics literature represents the uscor contemporary game theory in the analysis of oligopoly; see for example Vickers (1985). Dixon (1988) and of course the seminal graduate textbook by Tirole (1988). The 'new' in recent international trade literature represents the introduction of imperfect competition into the heart of trade theory. Of course, new theories and ideas arc always corning into being: economists come up with new ideas both from the incentive of theoretical invention. and the need to explain or auempt to understand contemporary economic phenomena. However, the adjective 'new' is introduced when there appears to he u shift in the approach by several economists at around t.hesame lime. Ineffect. a new school of thought or group of people with a common approach comes into being. How- ever,if we look ut the history of thought, the epithet 'new' has been used many times. In an academic environment where many people still had an education in Latin, the Latin 'nco' was preferred to the plain English 'new'. For example. the 74 11I1/!t'lfl'('/ ('1I1I1/I1'/ili(l11 ill NCII'Kevuesian EC()lIollli('.\\· 75 phrase 'nco-classicul' refer- not nn]y to <In archi rccturalstyle, 01'the musical idiom of Srruvinvky,hut al-.oto the inrcgrarion ofperfectly competitive econorn- ics both with general equilibrium theory. and with macroeconomics.

Imperfect compe- tition at its basic level meansthat agents (firms.households) are not price-takers: they havethe powerto ~ct price or wages.Even if all wages and prices are flex- ible, the presence of imperfect competition in itselfmeans thaI the economy will be dilfcrcntin a tundumcnral way from aperfectly cornpetilive economy. Before exploring the story ofimperfect competition in the macrocontext, let LIS just remind ourselves howspcciulthe as-umptionor perfectcompetition is. andhow it differs from impcrtcct competition.The fundamental idea can he illustrated within a ximplc microccouomic framework. Themacroeconomic implications will commenceafter the interlude. 3 IMPEI<FECr CQrvlPETITION FOR BEGINNEI{S: A MIC]{OECONOrvIIC INTFRLUDE There are different wayx of definingperfect cornpcutionr' however. for our pur- poses in thi~ chapter, we can pick out two important features: (a) all agcnt~ arc price-takers: (b)prices adjust to equate dcxi red supply and demand. When we say that agcnt~ arc price-takers. we mean that they treat the .market price' as given, theybelieve that they have no abilityto influence the market price. Thus, when perfectly competitive firms decide how much output to pro- duce, they treat the price a~ given and choose the output thut equates supply with demand. This decision definestheir !oupply function, which tells LIS how much they wish 10supply at different prices. Similarly with consumers in deciding demand. WIlen we say Ihal prin'~ adjuM to equate supply and demand, we mean that the market price i~ determincd (~()rnehowl) at the point where the sllpply and demand curve~ illtcr\"'cU at point I:in Figurt' 4.la. at price p*and quantity X*.

Note that if the output was below X\".for example at point.Xa as in Figure 4,tb, then total surplus will beless: producer surplus is now givenby the unshaded area below theprice line, and consumer surplus by theshaded area above the price line. From thepoint of view of social welfare, the net. gain toan additionalunit of output is the vertical distance or 'gap' at that OlUPUI between the demand curve (which represents the marginal value of output) and the marginal cost curve (which represents the marginal cost of output): atXi' IhiS gap Is GF. The totall.oss in surplus when we compareXu toX* is thetriangle OEE Ifoutput exceedsthe competitive level as at point X\",then this also reduces welfare. since nowthe mar· ginal cost of output exceeds the marginal value:the loss is givenby the triangle ElH. The lesson ofthis iIlustrat.ion is that the competitiveeqiliUbrimn is ina ParttCl* optimal outcome that maximises the sum ojprodll\"er and consumer surplus (thf! total SUrpIU.f). Any deviation from that OUtput, whether;t be an increas« or a decrease. willtend to reduce the toto! surplus. Nowlet us consider an imperiectly competitive equilibrium. forexample a monopoly. A monopolist will setits price lissomemurk-up over marginal cost. Forexample, in Figure 4.2,assume the profit maximiSing price of the monopolist is pM, with resultant outputXM.

The total loss is the triangleGEF in Fig- ure 4.2a,which is often called the 'social cost of monopoly'. Thus ifwe compare the monopoly outcome to the competitive outcome. we observe that in compari- son to the competitive outcome, (a)the level of economic activity is lower, and (b)the level of welfare is lower. However the difference does not end there: if for some reason the output is increased beyondX\", then of course total surplus will increase. For example. if outputincreases toXl in Figure 4,2b,then the gain in total surplus will be the shaded area GFKJ. Thus if we startfrom an imperfectly competitive equilibrium, then an increase in output will increase welfare. Hence we cansec that there arc two fundamental differences between the per- fectly competitive equilibrium andthe monopolistic equilibrium. First, the monopolistic equilibrium involvesa. lower level of welfare than the perfectly competitive equilibrium.Second. starting li'OlII the monopolistic equilibrium, tin increase in output increaseswelfare, 1I reduction reduces welfare.This contrasts with the competitive equilibrium where any deviation of output reduces welfare. Although the above analysisWas in terms of an output market. we could think in exactly the same way \"bout a labour market. withP being (he real wage, and X the level of employment. Whilst lhe analysis of this section has been cast in terms of simple microeco- nomics. its lessons will carryover into macroecononucs. The extra dimension added in macroeconomics is that the approach is general equilibrium:we have to consider equilibrium of all of the markers in the economy, and how they interact. 78 Mainlv Macro Now. perhaps it is time tu drop the general discussion of the word 'new', and to focus lin what we mean by using the word 'Keynesian' after new. Let's take a look back in history toBritain, and more specificallyCambridge in the 1930s. 4 OF KEYNES AND THE KEYNESIANS When Keynes first wrote The General Theorv(Keynes, 1936) in the mid- 1930s, he in effect gave birth tomacroeconomics as a discipline. Before that, the study of large-scale aggregate phenomena such as employment and national income was based on a predominantly rnicroeconomic and partial equilibrium perspec- tive. Even the notion of national income and the measurement of macroeconomic phenomena was not at all developed in a coherent. or useful way. Much of Keynes's contribution and that of the earliest macroeconomists was in providing a consistent and useful framework for national income statistics, and founding the accounting conventions that have now become standard. However, whilst Keynes developed a new theory and new ideas, heWas unable to develop11 fully integrated framework which was clearly related1.0 the existing approach of 'price theory'. or standard supply and demand analysis in either its partial equilibrium version, or its gene ra1equilibrium version as developed by Walras. Keynes designated this corpus of theory as 'classical', and he was clear thai his theory marked a definite departure from this classical approach. Thus. for example, he starts off The General Theoryby stating two of the postulates of clas- sical economics, which he defined as: IThe wage is equal to the marginal product oflabour. II 71w lIIi/il), of/he wage when a given volume of labour is employed is equal to the marginal disutilitv ofthat amount 14,mlf,'oyment. (Keynes,1936, p. 5) Postulate I states that the labour market. outcome is on the (competitive) labour demand curve: postulate II which Keynes rejected states thut the labour market outcome is on the labour supply curve. Clearly, the rejection of postulate II intro- duces the possibility of involuntatv unemployment,in that if the 'utility of the wage' exceeds the 'marginal disutility of work', then individuals willbe willing to work more than they are able to at the prevailing wage. We will discuss this in more detail below. However, this rejection of classical economics led to a tension within the postwar neoclassical synthesis. On the one hand. in mud!of microeconomics and subjects such as trade theory, the 'classical' approach largely dominated: agents were assumed to be price-takers: prices (and wages) adjusted so that markets cleared. Agents maximised something subject to some constraint. However. in macroeconomics, this approach was not taken; rather. a series ofseparate assumptions were made as necessary. For example, Keynes had been willing to assume that consumption was determinedby a basic psychological law: he had 1,lIjI('I,ku ('(lHlI}('lilillll illNClI' Keynesian Economics79 either not seen it a~ necessary. or simply did not have the time 10tinker with thi~ aspector his theory ,0a~ to show how it was related til the classical case. The phrase at! hochas often bCL:1Iused to describe this style of macroeco- nomics: wages were (for example) assumed to he downwardly but upwardly mobile. The most significant development in postwar Keynesian economics was probably the discovery(If the Phillips curve (195X). and its integration into macroeconomic models with lillie or no theoretical underpinning: with the notable exception of Lipsey (1960),orcourse, although the phrase lid 110('has usually been used pcrjorurivcly.there i~ nothing in principle wrung with tu! hoccrvwhere it i~ better than the hest 11011-11<1 hocalternative, Thus Keynes him- self was in Illy opinion quite right to freely develop a model of unemployment which was not fully worked nut in the traditional sense when the next best alter- native was a model lor which unemployment W;ISlargely assumed away. at a time during the 11)30s when ma~~ unemployment \\Va~ 'the' major policy issue.

Demand for e..eh good in principle depends on the prices of all goods. however indirectly. In his time. Walrus was somethingof avisionary. There arc certainly assumptions which underlie the Walrasian model. which is the general equilibrium version of the standard supply and demand model. At rhc mieroeconomiclevel, it isassumed Ihal agents(firms or households) arc price- takers. This means that they believe that theycan sell or buy as much as theywant al the prevailing market price. This is usually justified hy the notion that agents arc 'small'. too small to affect the market price (althoughrecent work suggests that youcan have competitive outcomes with only a few agcntx). This isa micro- economic assumption. However,in order for this microeconomicassumption to make sense. it is also necessary assume Ihal all markets clear in the sense that prices arcin place which equate planned demand with plannedsupply in allmar- kets.

The implication ofthis work was that traditionalKeynesian analysi» ofthe 'then' orthodoxy had in effectemascu- lated Keynes's original insights, and put them in aworld ofad hocery. Whatever the details of this phase. thc result was the crnt~rgencc of the neo- Keynesian school in the I970s,The phrase 'nco-Keynesian' is not auniversally acceptedterm, butit is one used by the main contributor duringthis phase: namely lean-Pascal Benassy, Benassy studied.11.

Theresult was Jean- Pascal Benassy'sthesis (1973).from which camethree papers (1975, 1976, 1978) which defined the nco-Keynesian approach. The first contributions in this phase came fromBurro andGrossman (1971. 1976,.and thereis much in com- mon between Ihe work of those authors andBcnassy, There is. however, alsoa big difference: whereas Bcnassy adopted.1 primarily general equilibrium approach. the work of Barro andGrossman was primarily macroeconomic.This difference is one ofperspective: both Burrounci Grossman onthe one hand. and Benassy on the other, were trying10 develop general equilibrium Illflcrornodels, Ihat is microfoundcd macroeconomics. However, thecmph asis W.ISdifferent: whereas Benassy allowed for many commodnies and looked at esoteric issues such as existence. Barro and OrOSSl11;111adopted the standard aggregation of macroeconomic models and hadjust three goods (consumption, leisure and money). The nco-Keynesian approach was popularised by Edmond Malinvaud's (1977)book Tile Theory of Unemployment Reconsidered,whichmade these ideas known and accessible to a general audience: und Mucllbauer and Portes (1978) also developed a simple textbook representution which was soon aft.er included in William Branson's (1980)graduate lllacrocconOllli(:s tc)(tbook.

The nCO-Kcync&ian school developed Ihe theory of how households lInd firms would behaveif they Imperfect Competition in New Keynesian Economics 83 faced limits on how much they could buy or sell. These models were referred to as quantit» constrainedor rationingmodels (see Levac ie and Rebmann. 1982 chapters 16 and17). However, Jet us start from the beginning. Looking back at Figure 4.3. we need 10consider what will happen in asituation where the price is fixed al alevel where supply exceeds demand, as at price P.The first step is to establish what trades will take place. In this situation, it is argued that the 'min condition' holds: that is. where supply (S)and demand (D)are different, then the amount actually traded isthe minimum (i.e.the smaller) of the two. In Figure 4.3, at price P. supply exceeds demand. Thus the min condition tells us that actual trading will beequal to demand D.This is depictedin Figure 4.4.For prices below the competitive price P*. supply is less than demand (there is excess demand). so that actual trades equal the quantity supplied; for prices above the competitive price. demand is the smaller ofthe two, sothat trades arc demand determined. The notion underlyingthe min condition is simple enough: youcan- not force people to trade more or less than they want to - trading is a voluntary activity. Thus, there is no way that the suppliers of a good can be forced to sup- ply more than they want to if demand exceeds supply, and vice versa.In mathe- matical terms. the min condition can be written as the quantity tradedX is: X = min (S. D) Now, recall that in this approach, we treat the price as a exogenous variable, as something fixed. We then trace through the consequences of this. Ifthe price is not equal tothe competitive price, then the planned or desired trades of agents are not consistent: they cannot bothbe realised. Thus one side of the market must have their plans frustrated. This is in contrast tothe Walrasian or perfectly Figure 4.4 TIU! min rondition s <. ...•.......•.• \". .............. \"0 X· 84 competitive price at which supply equalsdemand.

We can represent this in Figure4.6<1: on the vertical axis. we have the real wage, and output is on the horizontal axis; the function y'(W/,)) is downward-sloping (ahigher real wage means the firm wants to supply less output): the vertical liney =yR represents the demand constraint, Theactual level of output depends on the real wage: if this is high. as at point a' the firm desires to supply less than l.so that output is given by the output supply curve y'.However, ata point like b, where the real wage is low, the finn desires tosell more than the quantity constraint.In this case. we say that the firm is demand constrained.

The sim- ple answer is yes, there must have been. We can tell that from the fact thalAnns were willing to respond 10the increase in the demand by increasing output. and also that the households were willing 10supply more labour. Given that there is voluntary trade, any increase in output in Ibis posiuon must lead 10an increase in welfare of the household and profils of thefirm, In general. how can we tell when this will be the case,This turns OUI to be quite simple. In order to have a Keynesian multiplier likethis, one need to start off from an initial position in which IWO con- ditions are satisfied: (i) There isan excess supply of output: P> MC (ii) There is an excess supply of labour: WIP >disuliJity of labour. In order to understand (i),this simply says that thefinn would like 10sell more at the prevailing priceP: a finn will always want to sell more so long as its mar- ginal cost is less than price. Condition (i) simpl.y says that the finn isquantity constrained or rationed inthe amount of output ilcan sell,and henceus profits wiJI increase if itcan sell more.Asimilar observation applies 10condition (ii)for households: as in Figure 4.Sb. if me household can increase employment (reduce leisure), itcan increase utility by moving from 8(owards A.NOle that condition (i)corresponds to rhe relaxauon of Keynes's Classical Postulate I. and (ii)tothe relaxation of ClassicalPosrulare II. Thereis thus the question: under what iL~sumptions wjIJ we beinan. initial position where both (i)and (ii)are siuisfied? Here is Ihilcmtial link to lIN Keynesian economics. In brief,the answer isthat.imperfcctly competitive price/wage setting agents w.iJIensure thai (j)and (ii) are satisfied. Turning filS' to (i):if firmsare price-sellers, andface anon-perfeeny elastic demand Curve,then they will set their priceas a mark-upover marginalCost: a monopolist;monopo- listie finn or oligopolist will set the price above marginal cost asa. consequence of profit. maximisation. Turning to (ii)thereare a vari.cly of different stories. However, if wesuppose thatthe labour market is unionisedas inBlnnchatdand Kiyotaki (1987), thenthe union will aim 10set the realwage above thecQm,petitive real wage, and hence to aposition where lhe real wage exceedsthe marginw disu- tiJity of forgone leisure.The CUl!umentisentirely analogous 10the finn.

However, the mere fact thai the initial conditionis satisfied is nOI.enough to obtain a Keynesian multiplier: rigid prices are also needed. This is tbesecond, key step takenby the newKeynesians; \"om;',,\" pnce rigillity is morelikely When there is imperfectcompentton. Itis to this step Ihal. we now tum. 8 .NOMINAL RIGIDITY Aswe have seen in the previous section, ifthere is nominal rigidity (fh[e(J waaes or prices). then this can give rise to changes in nominaldemand huvingl'tal Imperfect Competitionill New Keynesian Economics 91 output and employment effects. One of the basil: insights of new Keynesian eco- nomics was to link this idea to that of imperfect competition. This link was made by Michael Parkin (1986), George Akerlof and Janet Yellen (19R5a,b), and Greg Mankiw (1985) in what has become known as the 'menu cost' theory, However, beforewe go intothe details of the menu cost theory. it is useful to briefly review another powerful idea: that of staggered contracts. The original new classical neutrality result of Sargent and Wallace (1976)showed that if prices adjusted instantaneously and agents held rational expectations, then only unan- ticipated changes in nominal demand could have an effect on real variables such as output andemployment, and furthermore that these effects could only last one period. The rca son for the transience of the effect was that agents with rational expectations will immediately update their beliefs and expectations in response 10 the information embodied in the shock. An early response to this was the Fischer (1977) and Taylor (1979) theory of overlapping or 'staggered'contracts: that is they took the basic Sargent and Wallace model, but added thereal world assumption that lirms/unions 8do not alladjust prices/wages at once: rather the adjustment of nominal prices is usually spread over the year due to overlap- ping or staggered contracts. The key re. ult of the staggered wage setting model is that the effects of shocks arc no longer limited to the period in which they occur. For example, suppose that 50 per cent of [inns/unions adjust prices in a par- ucular pcriod (there arc two groups who have two-period contracts, one group changes each period). Then when a shock occurs only those whose contracts are up for renew a1 arc able to adjust their contracts: the other 50 per cent are still locked into their old contract. Thus the effect of an unanticipated change in nom- inal demand will last for at least two periods, and there will be what is technically referred to as 'serial correlation' in output: a positive shock will lead to high out- put for a couple of periods, and a negative shock to low output. However, the early work of Fischer and Taylor, while tracing out the real effects of nominal rigidities, did not provide any explanation of the structure of nominal wage and price selling. What was needed was a theory of why nominal rigidities persist through time. 9 ENVELOPES, MENU COSTS AND NOMINAL RIGIDITY One of the key new Keynesian ideas was the notion that with price-selling firms, it was possible that nominal prices were more likely to berigid. The argument is very simple. Suppose that we have a monopolist who sets the price for his good. If he maximises profits, we have the familiar first-order condition that marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Now. of course, at the optimal or profit maximis- ing price, a small change in price will not lead to much change in profits, This is the meaning of tile first order condition, that the derivative of profits with respect toprice is equal tozero. To sec why, let us consider Figure 4.7, which a visual rep- resentation ofthe relationship between price (on the horizontal axis) and profit n· n. rr-, band of Inertia s.. Price 92 Profit Fi,lun 4.7 Menu cos,\",and the band(if'''(lrt;(1 (on the vertical). W~can see that at a low price (zero, 58Y1 profits are zero, and that at a high price P.the same is true. In between 0 and P,however. profits are positive, and we have the 'profit hill'.Aswe set.off from a1.ero price, profits at first increase; we are walking up theslope of theprofit hiJJ.However. as we get near to thetop, the slope becomes flatter and Oalle.r, until we reach the top.Atthe top. the hill must be Oat:if it had an upward slope. we could not beat the top. since we could gel higher byWalking up theSIOpe.9 In mathematical tenos, the derivative of profits with respect (0price measures the slope: and the tirst order condition for a maximum states that althe highest level of profits (the summit), profits are Ilat as we change price (the derivative is zero). Now. this is of course just the intuitive exp,lanalion(or the first. order conditions fora maximum. HOwever, ithas some powerful economic implications. and forms the basis for the 'menu cosr'argumene for nominal price .rigidity; Different, authors (Parkin, 1986; Akerlof and Yellen,1985; and Mankiw,.1985) all saw Ihatif there were some costs to changing prices. then even quile small COSIScould lead tosignif1. cant price rigidity. The reason is very simple: suppose thul we are near the top of the profit hill, say at point A in Figure 4.7. Furthermol'C, suppose that.itCOsts a certain amount'Y to change the price. In thiscasco wewill only incur thecost of changing price ifthe benefit we derive in terms of ext,.... profits is la1'8er than ;t. tmperfec: Competition in Nell' Keynesian Economics Now as we can see. if we are at A. the benefit is less than')I: on the vertical axis the maximum profit is 11*.and the profits at point A are ll\",which is greater than Il\" -I\"~Indeed, the tact that the hill is nat near tothe top means that although we arc not far from the top in terms of profits (the vertical height). the price might be quite far away from the optimal price p* (the horizontal distancePr,- P*). There is in fact a 'band of inertia' around the optimal price, representing all of those prices like I~,where the cost of changing price outweighs the benefits: this band is represented in Figure 4.7 by the range of prices on the horizontal axis between sandS: the reason fur thi~ notation will become dearer below, when we discuss (s,S)rules. Whilst this all sounds as if it has more todo with geography than macroeco- nornics. that is not so. Suppose that there is a change in demand, for example the demand curve shifts. In terms of Figure 4.7. the mountain would move, or at least the profit hill would shift in some way: suppose uuu the whole thing might move tothe right. Now rather than drawing the situation 'before' and 'after' the moun- lain moved. we can simply reinterpret Figure 4.7:P\" is the old optimal price before the mountain moved, and P*is the new optimal price, and the profiI. hill drawn is the 'after' one. We can now see that if there is not a big move in the mountain (i.e. demand does not change too much). then the gain from adjusting our price (increasing profits fromnil to.11* will not be very much, since the old optimal price l~,is still near to the top ofthe hill. and the slope of the hill is nat. This mathematical result is known as the envelope theorem.!\" Whal conclusion can we draw from this analysis? If a price-setting monopolist has some cos Isof adjusling price. then if there is a small change in demand (the mountain only moves u lillie bit), then he will nor change price. Even quite small menu costs can lead 10 significant price rigidity. Indeed, it.has long been observed lhat there is significant price rigidity in imperfectly competitive markets. and this is a possible explanation. However, whilst the menu costs mightbe quite small, as we have seen the welfare benefits of an increase in demand can be large. We know that a monopolist will mark up price over marginal costthe more inelastic demand, the higllcr the gap between price and marginal cost. 'In terms of social welfare. the market price of the output exceeds the social costs of production (which willbe equal tomarginal cost if the factor markets are perfectly cornpet- itive), The increase in welfare is shown in Figure 4.8. The demand curve Du is the initial demand curve corresponding to the optimal price I~,(you call link together Figure 4.7 and Figure 4.8): demand increases 10 Db, and the optimal price 'after' isP*. However. suppose that the change in demand is small,lIso that the potential gain in profits11\" to0* from Changing price from I~I top* is less than t.so lhat the price remains fixed atP\" and output will have increased fromX\" toX;1' In thisCase there is a gain in total welfare: for each extra unit of output produced, the marginal value of this output to consumers (represented by the market price ~r) exceeds the social cost of pro- duction (represented by the marginal costMC, here given).

If the price at any time is withinthe band of inertia. then the (s. S) indicates that it is optimal to leave the price where il is. However,if the price moves outside the boundary. then it shouldbe adjusted, with the exact ruJe for setting the new price depending on the expected behaviour of future pric-es. We depict the sort. of pricing behaviour by an individual firm When there is a con- stant background inflation, so that the 'optimal' price p.(t)follows a smooth upward trend equal to the rate of inflation, as in Figure 4.9. The optimal pricing rule involves the following behaviour: the price iskept constant until the actual price hits the bottom barrier; at that point thefirm will raise the price above the P*(t). and the.\" hold it constant.14 So. in Pigure 4.9, we can see that the optimal behaviour involvesrbe firm keeping the price constant most of the time. and having a periodic revision of [he price to keep in line with inflation (depicted at lime10 and tl)'This is realistic: we often observe firms which seem''' to publish new price lists at regular intervals (every quarter orevery year). Now CapJin and Spulber argued thai this type of behaviour at the micro level is perfectly consistent with complete price flexibility at the aggregate macro level. The argument is really quite simple. Imagine that We ate in Ancient Rome,lel and that there are tenmonths in the year. There are many firms, each with meno costs. following a (.f,S) rule. The background inflauen rate is 10 per cent per annum: eachfirmfinds iIoptimal to change Itsprice once per year. Thus, in lenns of Figure 4.9, each individual firm keeps its price constant for 9 months of the year. and on the 10th it changes its price by10 per cent. Now (and here isthe P(t) P-(t)+S ~~ ~\" p·(t)~ , , , ; '~(Ii \" \"~. .~ IiTime FI,,,,, 4.9Optimal pricing und,., lUI{s,S)rul« Imperfect Competitionill New Keynesian Economics 97 interesting bit). if the critical month at which each firm changes its price arc evenly spread over the year (1/10 each month). then the monthly inflation rate will be I per cent. Tosec why. in anyone month 9/10 of prices arefixed, and1/10 rise by 10 per cent: t.he average is therefore Iper cent [(0per cent x0.9) + (10 per cern x 0.1)= II.Thus, each month we can see prices 01'1 averagerising by I per cent: and over the 10 months there is a cumulative increase of 10 per centJ7 Thus, although there is a nominal rigidity at the individual linn level. the aggre- gate price timeseries is perfectly smooth. Caplin and Spulber'sargument rests on the notion that the incidence of price adjustment through time is even: each monthsees anequal proportionof firms changingprice.In fact they made alot of very special assumptions to ensure that this was the case, andit is not a gen- eral result. Alan Sutherland (1995) analysed this in somewhat more detail, and found that 'clustering' was amore commonphenomenon: firmswould tend to arrange to change their prices together. In that case the aggregate price index would not heso smooth. In practice. we often observe such 'clustering': lots of prices change just after Christmas. and soon. Hence microeconomicprice rigid- ity can lead tu macroeconomicprice rigidity. One of the main empirical tests of the menu cost theory suggested by Ball, Mankiw and Romer (1988)was that there would bea relationshipbetween infla- tion and theresponsi\\leness ofoutput to nominaldemand shocks. In a high infla- tion country.the frequency with which firmsadjust theirprices willbe higher. Hence any potential nominal rigidity will be less persistent, sothatif there is a nominal demand shock (e.g. an unanticipated change in nominal national income). then the possibilit.y of it translating into areal output change is less. The main prediction of the menu costtheory is therefore that the translation ofnom- inal demand shocks into real output changes will beless in high inflation coun- tries. They found some empirical evidence for this relationship looking at a large cross section of countriesover a couple ofdecades. 10 IMPERFECT COMPETITION AND THE MULTIPLIER WITH FLEXIBLE PRICES lrnpertcct competition plays a crucial role in the theory of new Keynesian macro- economics. As we saw ill the analysis of menu costs, it.provides the basis ofa theory of IWllli/wl price rigidity. However. it also provides the foundation of a theory of real rigidity: imperfect competition is an alternative equilibrium con- cept to the Walrasiun one where supply equals demand. Imperfect. competition provides (Illexplanation of how prices arc etby optimising agents rather thanby fictitious auctioneers. However, the importance goes further than that, since the imperfectly competitive equilibrium may well be one where price exceeds mar- ginol cost, andif the labour market: is unionised. one where there might be invol- untary uncmployment. In snort, the unpctfectly competitive equilibrium might be •Keynesiun'in some sense. Itis this possibility that I explore next.

This means that the amount of expenditure necessary to yield a given increase in employment is smaller. Whilst we can sec the mathematics quite clearly. what is the intuitive reason behind this result? All three authors (Dixon. Mankiw and Startz)provide the same explanation, in terms of the IJrojit multiplier, which is really quite simple to understand. Suppose that the government increases expenditure by an amount dg. Now. this will be received by the firms as income: they will pass some of the income to households in the form of profits. The initial increase in output asso- ciated with the increased expenditure is dN =dg:the extra profits resulting from this arc then udg,which will then appear in the household's budget constraint in the form of profits. The household will (from equation (4.19)), decide to spend a proportioner. of this, thus causing an additional increase in output oft:X1.uig, and so 00.24If there is perfect competition and 110profits, then there can be no profit multiplier: but with 1110reimperfect competition and a larger mark-up, this effect will be more powerful. Whilst we have looked at the impact of imperfect com- petition of the government expenditure, it will also apply to other real shocks, such as productivity and real exchange rate shocks. Wecall showthe effect of imperfect competition on the multiplier diagram- rnaticaly in Figure 4.11. The vertical and horizontal axes are consumption and leisure as before. and the income expansion paths correspond to those in Figure4.10. The new feature is toinclude the production possibility frontier for the, case I~W I-a 102 c o where thereis governmentexpenditure. Thereis one unit of limenllocut.ed to the household:it can spread this between work tu produce output andleisure: y+L=1 (4.25) Wecan think of[his us the production pos!!ibilit)' frontier (PPF) for the economy~ However. since OUlput is divided between Cand s.we can rewrite (4.25)as: c= I~l.-g (4.26) This isrepresented by thedownward-sloping 45° line in Figure4.11.

Clearly, ill both ofthese cases. the level of consumption has been reduced in response tothe increase in governmentexpenditure (there is crowding out): however, the reduction is less than the increase in government expenditure (there is less than lOOper cent crowding out). In the Walrasian case. the reduction in consumption is ~C'\" .and in the imperfectly competitive case !lewClearly. since the slope of the imperfectly competitive IEP is less than the Walrasian IEP. it follows that the degree ofcrowding out is less. since: Thus, the reason that the multiplier is greater in the imperfectly competitive case is thutthere is less crowding out. As we can see from the above analysis. there is an important issue as to whether the multiplier is Keynesian or not: in Dixon (1987c).I called themulti- plier 'Walrasian'. since the mechanism by which output. increases is that house- holds aremade worse off (since leisure is a normal good, if thelabour supply increases. then the household mu t beworse off if the real wage is unchanged). Others (Mankiw, 1988; Startz, 1989)have interpreted such effects asKeynesian. However, whatever interpretation one has, the clear message isthat imperfect competition mattershere. 10.2 Imperfect CompetiUon in the Labour Market Whilst. imperfectcompetition in theoutput market alone cangive rise to some Keynesian effects, it cannot. explain involuntary unemployment,If the labour market is perfectly competitive, then real wages will be such that households will be able tosupply all of the labour they wish. Whilst there maybe underemploy- ment in the labour market (in the sen Cthat the level of employment is lower than inthe walrasian equilibrium). all)'unemploymentis voluntary, Let us look alillie bit moreclosely at the,nature of underemployment,and con- sider again the model of the previous section. Equation (4.21) can be interpreted as uie demand curvefor labour:it states that the real wage Wequals the marginal product of labour (which was assumed 10equal I) times (I -It).Theusual demand for tabour curve isof course assumed to bedownward-sloping, because it is usual to assume a diminishing marginal product of labour. However, whether the marginal product of labour is constant or decreasing doesnot alter the argu- ment. Suppose we depict a labour supply curve, and suppose that the labour sup- ply depends onlyupon the real wage as depicted in Figure 4.12. In this case as II increases, the labourdemand curve shifts downwards: andhence the equilibrium level of employment decreases. The fact that employment is below its Walrasian level when I' >0isdefined as underemployment. 104 WIP (WIP~ Fi,\"\" 4.12 However. involuntary unemployment arises onlyif lhe householdis otr ita labour supply curve. lmperfecl. compelition is u way of e\"plaJning wbythismIIIIt be the case.

RobinMurris (1991) haswritten definitively onthe subject of Keynes andimper- fect competition, and there islittle doubt thatKeynes rarely thought about imper- fect. competition. However, this is in u sense very surprising since atthe same time as Keynes was developinghismacroeconomic theory, the theory of imper- fect competition was being developed(It the same university byJoan Robinson and Richard Kuhn.The explanation appears to have to do with social mores of 106 MClin/_\\' Mlll'm Cambridge in the 193Os, and personal tensions between the three, Unlike ~ Kahn and Robinson were very much heterosexual. Indeed they had an affair,willa Keynes more than once entering Kahn's room to find them both onthe floor.

There canbe aPareto improvement, with everyone better off. The microeconomics of the consumer andthe firm with arbitraryfixed wages and prices was developed and perfected in the 1970s, and this was well-understood. The key contributionof new Keynesian economics has been to use imperfect competition as a foundationforall equilibrium in which firmsand households bothwant 10sell more, and OIl0 as a theoryof nominal rigidity. I started uffthis chapterby looking at the word 'new' in economics: how it applied 10such areasas the new industrial economics and the new trade theory in the I980s. I willconclude with the observation that in all of thesefields, muchof the 'newness' has arisen from the introduction of imperfectly competitive mod- els into what werebefore either ad hocorWalrnsian approaches.In this sense, the new Keynesian macroeconomics is simply one aspect of the increasing recog- nition of economists of theimportance of imperfect competition in explaining the economic world in which we live.
