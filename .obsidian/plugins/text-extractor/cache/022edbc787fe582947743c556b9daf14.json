Source: Who Was Milton Friedman and What Is Monetarism? Learning Objectives Under this topic, we will learn about: • The monetarist policy prescription • The main assumptions of the policy prescription • How Friedman suggested a modification of the original Phillips Curve to describe the natural level of output Monetarist Policy Prescription Monetarism is best known for its policy prescription by Milton Friedman: “To achieve price stability, money supply growth rate should be equal to the trend growth rate of real output.” Assumptions The assumptions that underpin the monetarist policy prescription are: 1. 𝑀𝑀𝑑𝑑 = k(…)PY where 𝑀𝑀𝑑𝑑 denotes money demand, k velocity of money, and (…) shows k is a function of various interest rates. P and Y denotes price level and real output, respectively. • This is a more sophisticated version of the Quantity Theory of Money: MV = PY or M =(1/V)PY where M denotes money supply, V velocity of money and k=1/V. Assumptions 2. In the long-run (or medium-run using Blanchard’s terminology) output is at its natural level, which is independent of the money supply. • Using M =kPY , this implies P must be proportional to M. • More realistically, if Y grows at a trend rate of 𝑔𝑔𝑦𝑦, then π = 𝑔𝑔𝑚𝑚 - 𝑔𝑔𝑦𝑦 where π denotes the inflation rate and 𝑔𝑔𝑚𝑚 denotes the growth rate of money supply. The Phillips Curve (PC) • To introduce the natural rate of unemployment, Friedman started from the original idea of the Phillips Curve (PC). • Phillips plotted the rate of inflation against the rate of unemployment in the UK from 1861 to 1957. • Samuelson and Solow replicated Phillips’s exercise for the US, using data from 1900 to 1960. • The original PC showed that there is a permanent trade-off between inflation and unemployment: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 = 𝛽𝛽 − 𝛼𝛼𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡 Inflation versus Unemployment in the US for 1900–1960 Expectations-augmented PC • Friedman’s argument (1968) was that the original PC only made sense if people expected inflation to be equal to zero. Otherwise, the permanent trade-off would break down. • If workers expected inflation to be positive, this would mean the expectations- augmented PC is given by: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡= 𝛽𝛽 + 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝐸𝐸 −𝛼𝛼𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡 • This implies there are various PCs, one of which is the original PC, with 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝐸𝐸 = 0. Inflation versus Unemployment in the US for 1970–2010 Expectations-augmented PC • Graphical representation of the various Phillips Curves: u 0 π π0 e = 0 π1 e π2 eπ1 e π2 e u Expectations-augmented PC • The PC trade-off arises as workers base their labour supply decisions on the expected real wage, 𝑊𝑊 𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒 , whereas firms base their labour demand decisions on the actual real wage, 𝑊𝑊 𝑃𝑃 . • Imagine now 𝑃𝑃 (or 𝜋𝜋) is higher than expected. • Firms can then offer higher 𝑊𝑊, incentivising workers to supply more labour as their expected real wage is now higher. • It is the error in workers’ expectations that makes it possible for unemployment to change temporarily. Expectations-augmented PC • Now consider what happens when the government wants to permanently lower unemployment, starting from point A. • In the short-run, the economy shifts from point A to B, inflation increases. • With a lag, workers revise their expectations: 𝜋𝜋1 𝑒𝑒 = 𝜋𝜋0 and the economy moves to point C. • The government then needs to move the economy to point D to lower unemployment. • This increases actual and then expected inflation even further. u0 π π0e = 0 B A C D E π0 π1 π1e = π0 π2 e = π1 Natural level of output or natural rate of unemployment • If we define the long-run as where P = 𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒 (or 𝜋𝜋 = 𝜋𝜋𝑒𝑒) and 𝑢𝑢 = 𝑢𝑢𝑛𝑛 (natural rate of unemployment), then the long-run PC is vertical. • Implication: if the government wants to keep inflation constant, this is possible only at 𝑢𝑢𝑛𝑛. u0 π π0 e = 0 π1 e π2 e Long-Run Phillips Curve Short-Run Phillips Curves 𝑢𝑢𝑛𝑛 Natural level of output or natural rate of unemployment • The expectations-augmented PC can be rewritten as 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 − 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝐸𝐸 = −𝛼𝛼(𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡 − 𝑢𝑢𝑛𝑛) • Corresponding to the 𝑢𝑢𝑛𝑛 in the long-run, we have a natural level of output, 𝑌𝑌𝑛𝑛. Accordingly, the expectations- augmented PC curve can be written as: 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 − 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛= 𝜃𝜃( 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 − 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝑒𝑒) where 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 is the natural log of real output. • As before, we assume people form their expectations such that 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝑒𝑒 = 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1 (1) • Substituting this in the equation above, we get 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 − 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛=𝜃𝜃( 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1) • This is called the “accelerationist” version of the PC. Adaptive Expectations • A generalisation of the assumption 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝑒𝑒 = 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1, known as the “adaptive expectations” formula is 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝑒𝑒 − 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1 𝑒𝑒 = (1 − λ)(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1 − 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1 𝑒𝑒 ), where 0≤ λ ≤1. • This can be rewritten as 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝑒𝑒 = (1 − λ)𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1 + λ 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1 𝑒𝑒 • Using the above formula lagged and continuing to substitute out the lagged expected inflation terms, we get 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝑒𝑒 = (1 − λ)(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1+ λ𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−2+ λ2 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−3+…) (2) • A further generalisation gives 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝑒𝑒 = ∑𝑖𝑖=1 ∞ 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−𝑖𝑖 (3) where 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 are arbitrary sequence of weights Adaptive Expectations • In his argument, Friedman (1968) did not explicitly use any “adaptive expectations” formula, but from his explanation it was clear that this is the type of expectations-formation that he had in mind. • In the 1960s, this was generally how macroeconomists thought the public made their forecasts.
