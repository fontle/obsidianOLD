Globalisation refers to the process of economies becoming more integrated and interdependent, it involves the ‘transfers of commodities, people, capital and ideas between and within continents’ (Judith, 2010).1 Depending on the time period, economic historians can use a variety of sources however the main two are: The value of trade, by analysing the value exports and imports histori- ans can find insights into the degree of integration in global markets, a growth in trade over a period would highlight an increased market integration. Sec- ondly,Migration, the movement of people between economies, highlights greater labour integration and enables the diffusion of ideas and knowledge, also in- dicative of a greater degree of globalisation. Historians can appraise the level of migration through ticket records for ships and trains, or exogenous variables such as disease exchanges (Stearns, 2009).2 Meanwhile, Taylor and Williamson (1997) 3 used wages to measure the impact of migration: between 1870-1914 caused wage dispersion to fall by 28%, showing a convergence between poor and richer countries. What Was the New Economic Policy in the Soviet Union? The New Economic Policy (1921-1928) was a response by Lenin to the conse- quences of war communism, it involves a set of economic policies that hypo- thetically enabled the transition to socialism by acknowledging the relevance of markets and private property in recovery: in the words of Lenin ‘one step backwards in order to take two steps forward’. It involved partial decentralisa- tion: returning of agriculture and other sectors such as retail back to private ownership. This allowed peasants to cultivate their own land and sell surplus on the market whilst engaging in small-scale trade. Furthermore, elements of monetary policy were re-introduced: a convertible currency backed by the gold standard called chervonets, allowing for greater trade with other economies. Economically, it was successful with economic growth in the period at 16.3% in the Soviet Union, far greater than any other CESEE economy, however when accounting for GDP levels pre World War I, the Soviet Union was the last to recover in 1928.

State socialism is government system characterised by the central planning of the economy rather than market allocation through government fiat. On the other hand, in Das Kapital, Marx describes communism as the final stage of development, whilst socialism is the transitory period between capitalism and communism. He described a ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ where the workers seize the means of production creating an absence of a centralised state, and envisions the abolition of private property (Marx, 1959).5 Alternatively, state socialism heavily relies on central planning, through the nationalisation of indus- tries, resources and key-sectors of the economy. For example, collectivisation of capital to workers under state socialism still resulted in significant control by the state: In Stalin’s first 5 year plan there were state-imposed quotas on in- dividuals as both state-controlled (Sovkhozes) and collectively-controlled farms (Kolkhozes), thus the power of the state never truly turned to the hands of workers as envisioned by communism. Since communism deviates from social- ism in terms of the role of the state they should not be considered identical concepts, meanwhile, since they both embody address the inequalities created by capitalism there are overlaps between the concepts. To what Extent Was Technological Failure the Cause of Britain’s Late Victorian Economic Decline? [[Attachments/HistorySummerExamFinal-2.png|center|400]] Figure Two: Levels and rate of growth of real GDP per capita (Crafts, 2004)6 Britain was the first economy to industrialise during the 18th century and ex- perienced unparalleled growth that was not seen by any economy previously. Despite being well ahead of Germany and the United States, its growth began to slow in during the second industrial revolution (1870-1914). As shown by figure 2, the real rate of growth in the UK was 1.0 (constant) during the second industrial revolution, meanwhile Germany and the United States experienced 60% and 80% expansions in real GDP respectively during the same period.

In Absolute terms, the British economy did not decline and thus did not face a recession, however, relative to other industrialising economies in Europe, Britain faced a stark decline in its proportion of global manufacturing output. As seen in figure three, the UK share of national manufacturing output was comparable to Germany and the United States in 1880 at 22.9%. By 1913 its national share fell to 13.6%, falling short of both Germany and the US with 14.8% and 32% respectively. Britain’s absolute stagnation and its relative de- cline must be framed in the context of the industrialisation of both Germany and the US, did Britain fall behind due to endogenous changes such as lack of technological innovation or did Germany and the US simply over take due to their inherent advantages? Both the first and second industrial revolutions are hallmarked by major inno- vations: the former by steam and coal, and the latter built on electricity and combustion engines (Smil, 2005).8 History of Modern Britain.
