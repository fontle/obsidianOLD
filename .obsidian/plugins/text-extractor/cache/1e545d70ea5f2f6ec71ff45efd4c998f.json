In the next part, we will discuss how to determine the value today of a cash flow expected in the future. 21 Time value of money: A “simple” concept £100 received on your birthday this year ≠ £100 you will receive on your birthday next year 22 Notations FV Future value PV Present value r Interest rate or discount rate t Number of periods 23 Time value of money: The single- period case 24 Example 1 • You are offered the following opportunity: • Today, you will pay £400,000 for an artwork. • In 1 year from now, I will buy back the said artwork at the price £480,000 • The bank interest rate is 25%. Will you accept my offer? 25 Example 2 • Suppose you deposit £100 for 1 year at an interest rate of 10%. • How much will it amount to in 1 year? • How much will it amount to if you leave it in the account for another year, assuming the interest rate stays the same? 26 • This process of leaving your money and any accumulated interest in an investment for more than one period, and thereby reinvesting the interest, is called compounding • Compounding the interest means earning interest on interest • Compound interest = interest earned on both the initial principal and the interest reinvested from prior periods • Simple interest = interest earned only on the original principal 27 Time value of money: The multi- period case 28 Example 3 (1) Suppose we had an investment that was going to pay £1,000 at the end of every year for the next 5 years. Interest rate is 6%. What is the PV of these cash flows? • PV calculated by discounting each cash flow separately: 29 Example 3 (2) PV calculated by discounting back one period at a time: 30 NPV of multiple cash flows: The Algebraic formula 31 Compounding periods Sometimes interest is charged more frequently than once per year Semi- Annually (2 times a year) Quarterly (4 times a year) Monthly (12 times a year) Weekly (52 times a year Daily (365 times a year) Continuous 32 Compounding more than once a year over many years where • C0 is the initial investment • r is the stated annual interest rate (the annual interest rate without consideration of compounding) – also called quoted interest rate, nominal interest rate • m is the number of times the investment is compounded in a year • t is the number of years 33 Example 4 Mr. Bean is investing £5,000 at a stated annual interest rate of 12% per year, compounded quarterly, for five years. What is his wealth at the end of five years? 34 Continuous compounding 𝐹𝑉=𝐶 0×𝑒 𝑟𝑡 35 Simplifications Perpetuity • A constant stream of cash flows that never ends Growing Perpetuity • A stream of cash flows that grow at a constant rate infinitely Annuity • A constant stream of cash flows that last for a fixed number of periods Growing Annuity • A stream of cash flows that grow at a constant rate for a fixed number of periods 36 Perpetuity and Growing Perpetuity • Perpetuity • Growing perpetuity where g is the growth rate (assume g<r) 37 Annuity 38 Growing Annuity Assume g<r 39 Quiz 1 Mrs. Brown has just won a competition paying £50,000 a year for 20 years. She is to receive her first payment a year from now. The competition organizers advertises this as the Million Pound Competition because £1,000,000 = £50,000  20. If the interest rate is 8%, what is the true value of the prize? 40 Quiz 2 Mr. Bean has just been offered a job at £80,000 a year. He anticipates his salary increasing by 9% a year until his retirement in 40 years. Given an interest rate of 20%, what is the present value of his lifetime salary? 41 Quiz 3 Solve for the unknown interest rate in each of the following cases 42 Quiz 4 Solve for the unknown number of years in each of the following cases 43 Quiz 5 Compute the future value of $1,900 continuously compounded for a. 7 years at a stated annual interest rate of 12% b. 5 years at a stated annual interest rate of 10% c. 12 years at a stated annual interest rate of 5% d. 10 years at a stated annual interest rate of 7% 44 Quiz 6 Conoly Co. has identified an investment project with the following cash flows. If the discount rate is 10%, what is the present value of these cash flows? Year Cash flow ($) 1 960 2 840 3 935 4 1,350","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
