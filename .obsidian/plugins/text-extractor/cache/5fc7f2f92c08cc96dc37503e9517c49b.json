We will consider three cases: 1. Perfect competition and no adjustment costs 2. Perfect competition and adjustment costs – Tobin’s Q model of investment 3. Imperfect competition and no adjustment costs Microfounded Investment 1. Perfect competition and no adjustment costs Investment costs: 𝐶 𝐼 = 𝑃𝐼𝐼 Where 𝑃𝐼 is the exogenous price of investment goods and I is the volume of investment undertaken. Microfounded Investment 1. Perfect competition and no adjustment costs Profit-maximization at t=0 means maximization of: 𝑃𝑓 𝐼 + 𝐾−1 𝑟 − 𝑃𝐼𝐼 Which requires 𝑃𝑓′ 𝐾 𝑟 − 𝑃𝐼 = 0 hence 𝑃𝑓′ 𝐾 𝑟𝑃𝐼 = 1 and 𝑃𝑓′ 𝐾 𝑟𝑃𝐼 ≡ 𝑞 (or ‘marginal q’) Microfounded Investment 1. Perfect competition and no adjustment costs 𝑃𝑓′ 𝐾 𝑟𝑃𝐼 ≡ 𝑞 (or ‘marginal q’) • The numerator – the marginal value product of capital • The denominator – the ‘user cost of capital’ Microfounded Investment 1. Perfect competition and no adjustment costs At the optimum, 𝑃𝑓′ 𝐾∗ 𝑟𝑃𝐼 = 1 𝑓′ 𝐾∗ = 𝑟𝑃𝐼 𝑃 e.g. 𝑓 𝐾 = 𝐾0.5, then 0.5 𝐾∗ −0.5 = 𝑟𝑃𝐼 𝑃 Microfounded Investment 1. Perfect competition and no adjustment costs and 𝐾∗ −0.5 = 2𝑟𝑃𝐼 𝑃 𝐾∗ = 2𝑟𝑃𝐼 𝑃 − 1 0.5 = 2𝑟𝑃𝐼 𝑃 −2 = 𝑃 2𝑟𝑃𝐼 2 Hence 𝐼∗ = 𝐾∗ − 𝐾−1 = 𝑃 2𝑟𝑃𝐼 2 − 𝐾−1 Microfounded Investment 1. Perfect competition and no adjustment costs In general 𝐼 = 𝐼 𝑟, 𝑃𝐼, 𝑃 (underpinning the IS curve) Investment: • Falls with the interest rate • Falls in the price of investment goods • Increases in the price of final output goods Microfounded Investment 2. Perfect competition and adjustment costs: Tobin’s Q model of Investment • e.g. costs associated with training workers to use new capital • Adjustment costs normally assumed to be quadratic in the amount of investment: 𝐶 𝐼 = 𝑃𝐼𝐼 + 𝑎 2 𝑃𝐼𝐼2 Microfounded Investment 2. Perfect competition and adjustment costs: Tobin’s Q model of Investment Analysis now incorporates depreciation, hence 𝐼𝑡 = 𝐾𝑡 − 1 − 𝛿 𝐾𝑡−1 To simplify, assume linear production: 𝑦 = 𝑓𝐾𝐾, where 𝑓𝐾 is the constant marginal product of capital. Microfounded Investment 2. Perfect competition and adjustment costs: Tobin’s Q model of Investment Firm now chooses I to maximize: 𝑃𝑓𝐾𝐾 1 + 𝑟 + 𝑃𝑓𝐾𝐾 1 − 𝛿 1 + 𝑟 2 + ⋯ − 𝑃𝐼𝐼 − 𝑎 2 𝑃𝐼𝐼2 Which simplifies to 𝑃𝑓𝐾 𝐼𝑡 + 1 − 𝛿 𝐾𝑡−1 𝑟 + 𝛿 − 𝑃𝐼𝐼 − 𝑎 2 𝑃𝐼𝐼2 Microfounded Investment 2. Perfect competition and adjustment costs: Tobin’s Q model of Investment The first-order condition is 𝑃𝑓𝐾 𝑟 + 𝛿 − 𝑃𝐼 − 𝑎𝑃𝐼𝐼 = 0 Which implies 𝐼 = 1 𝑎 𝑃𝑓𝐾 𝑃𝐼 𝑟 + 𝛿 − 1 Microfounded Investment 2. Perfect competition and adjustment costs: Tobin’s Q model of Investment i.e. 𝐼 = 1 𝑎 𝑞 − 1 Note that 𝑞 is a sufficient determinant of 𝐼. Microfounded Investment 2. Perfect competition and adjustment costs: Tobin’s Q model of Investment • Greater adjustment costs (a) – dampen response of 𝐼 to all other drivers – Could cause higher or lower 𝐼 depending on whether 𝑞 ≷ 1. • Greater value of marginal product of capital (𝑃𝑓𝐾) – Increases investment (e.g. induced by technological progress or demand) Microfounded Investment 2. Perfect competition and adjustment costs: Tobin’s Q model of Investment • Increases in Relative prices of capital goods (𝑃𝐼/𝑃) – reduces 𝐼 – e.g. investment subsidies • Increases in the real interest rate (𝑟) – Reduces investment • Increases in the depreciation rate (𝛿) – Reduces investment Microfounded Investment 2. Perfect competition and adjustment costs: Tobin’s Q model of Investment Measuring 𝑞 Recall 𝐼 = 1 𝑎 𝑞 − 1 and 𝑞 = 𝑃𝑓𝐾 𝑃𝐼 𝑟+𝛿 . Suppose a small change in the capital stock of a firm. Then 𝑞 = ΔMarket Value purchase price of additional capital goods Tobin’s q Model of investment • Firms with a capital stock of K0 receive revenue of X above cost of capital on each additional unit of K K0 X K* q > 1 • The market value of firm depends on expected future profits. • Because of X the market will place a high value on firm - so (q > 1) q = 1 • Investment will take K to K* where q = 1 𝑃𝑓𝐾 𝑃𝐼 𝑟 + 𝛿 Microfounded Investment 2. Perfect competition and adjustment costs: Tobin’s Q model of Investment Defining (average) 𝑄: 𝑄 = Market Value replacement cost of capital stock 𝑄 and 𝑞 are related, but also 𝑄 is observable (i.e. at the level of the firm.) Microfounded Investment 2. Perfect competition and adjustment costs: Tobin’s Q model of Investment 𝑄 = Market Value replacement cost of capital stock The role of Q in a simple example: • Average market price of house: £200,000 • Cost to build a new house: £120,000 • Tobin’s 𝑄 = £200,000 £120,000 = 1.67 • Since 𝑄 > 1 investment (building) will take place Microfounded Investment 3. Imperfect competition and no adjustment costs • Price now endogenous, with demand curve: 𝑦𝑖 = 𝑃𝑖 −𝜂 𝑌 𝑛 ⟺ 𝑃𝑖 = 𝑦 𝑖 −1 𝜂 𝑌 𝑛 1 𝜂 Where Y is aggregate demand, 𝜂 is the elasticity of demand and 𝑛 is the number of sectors (each firm is a sector: 𝑖=1,…,n). Microfounded Investment 3. Imperfect competition and no adjustment costs Issue: if the firm increases 𝐾𝑖, it now results in a fall in price. Choice of investment level maximizes: 𝑃𝑖𝑓 𝐾𝑖 𝑟 + 𝛿 − 𝑃𝐼𝐼𝑖 With First Order Condition (FOC): 1 𝑟 + 𝛿 𝜕 𝑃𝑖𝑓 𝐾𝑖 𝜕𝐼𝑖 − 𝑃𝐼 = 0 Microfounded Investment 3. Imperfect competition and no adjustment costs In the (simplifying) situation of 𝑦𝑖 = 𝑓 𝐾𝑖 = 𝐾𝑖 𝜕 𝑃𝑖𝑓 𝐾𝑖 𝜕𝐼𝑖 = 𝜕 𝑦 𝑖 −1 𝜂 𝑌 𝑛 1 𝜂 𝐾𝑖 𝜕𝐼𝑖 = 𝜕 𝐾 𝑖 −1 𝜂 𝑌 𝑛 1 𝜂 𝐾𝑖 𝜕𝐼𝑖 = 𝜕 𝐾 𝑖 1−1 𝜂 𝑌 𝑛 1 𝜂 𝜕𝐼𝑖 Microfounded Investment 3. Imperfect competition and no adjustment costs Note that 𝐾𝑖 = 1 − 𝛿 𝐾𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝐼𝑖, hence 𝜕 𝑃𝑖𝑓 𝐾𝑖 𝜕𝐼𝑖 = 𝜂 − 1 𝜂 𝑌 𝑛 1 𝜂 𝐾 𝑖 −1 𝜂 Substituting this into the FOC above, then 1 𝑟 + 𝛿 𝜂 − 1 𝜂 𝑌 𝑛 1 𝜂 𝐾 𝑖 −1 𝜂 − 𝑃𝐼 = 0 Microfounded Investment 3. Imperfect competition and no adjustment costs Hence 𝐾𝑖 = 𝜂 − 1 𝜂 𝑟 + 𝛿 𝑃𝐼 𝜂 𝑌 𝑛 And so using 𝐼𝑖 = 𝐾𝑖 − 1 − 𝛿 𝐾𝑖,𝑡−1 then 𝐼𝑖 = 1 𝑛 𝜂 − 1 𝜂 𝑟 + 𝛿 𝑃𝐼 𝜂 𝑌 − 1 − 𝛿 𝑌𝑡−1 This is the accelerator model of investment. Evidence • Microfounded theories argue for the importance of: – q (or Q) – which depends on the ratio of the market value of the firm and the replacement cost of capital (in the case of competition in goods markets) – Economic growth – or ‘scale’ effects (in the case of imperfect competition) • Empirically the former seem to be unimportant relative to the latter Evidence Why? • Real (goods) markets are imperfect? • Observed market value (share price*number of shares – or ‘market capitalization’) a poor measure of true market value (i.e. capital markets arguably not fully efficient, and subject to noise trade) • Investment is ‘lumpy’ – hence observed Q>1, but investment may still not take place – Observed data on investment is also very discontinuous Evidence Why? • Cash flow & Credit constraints – Reminiscent of empirical consumption findings: ‘excess sensitivity’ to cashflow • The role of uncertainty & risk aversion – Entails ‘option value’ to not investing – Hence expected rate of return must be meaningfully higher than investment costs Conclusions • Investment remains difficult to understand, specify or certainly forecast. • The emphasis here is on microfounded decisions – whether embedded in: – Competitive markets – Tobin’s Q model of investment – arguing that Q = Market Value replacement cost of capital stock is a sufficient determinant of investment – Imperfect competition – emphasising scale- economies – and giving an underpinning for the Accelerator model","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
