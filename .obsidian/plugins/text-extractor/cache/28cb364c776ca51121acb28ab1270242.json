A quarter of a century on, the picture is mixed: in many CESEE countries, the transformation process is incomplete, and the economic catch-up has taken longer than anticipated. The current situation has highlighted the need for a better understanding of the long-term political and economic implications of the Central, East and South-East European historical experience. This thematically organised text oﬀers a clear and comprehensive guide to the economic history of CESEE from 1800 to the present day. Bringing together authors from both East and West, the book also draws on the cutting-edge research of a new generation of scholars from the CESEE region. Presenting a thoroughly modern overview of the history of the region, the text will be invaluable to students of economic history and CESEE area studies.

First and foremost, I would like to thank all 24 contributing authors for their time and eﬀort since launching the book project in 2015. One of the obstacles we faced in writing a regionally balanced economic history of Central, East and South-East Europe was that each of the three sub-regions had developed their own historiography largely independently from each other. We needed the dif- ferent research traditions to communicate with each other, which would not have been possible without the great intellectual curiosity of the participants and their active involvement with this project. This often involved forming co-authorships by bringing together experts on the diﬀerent sub-regions. An important step in this process was a contributors’ conference held in Regensburg, Germany, on 19th and 20th May 2016, where authors presented a ﬁrst version of their book chapters. I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Ulf Brunnbauer, director of the Leibniz Institute for East and South-East European Studies, for hosting the event; and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and the Economic History Society for ﬁnancial support. Stephan Barisitz, Carsten Burhop, Konrad Clewing, Richard Frensch, Mark Harrison, Jüren Jerger, Uwe Müller, Stefano Petrungaro, Sabine Rutar, Ekaterina Selezneva, Mark Spörer and Peer de Vies provided excellent comments on this occasion. I am grateful to my wife Marianna for her support, patience and encourage- ment for a research project that took much longer than anticipated. Marianna was inspirational in one important aspect of this edited volume. She reinforced my determination to incorporate her native Greece into the book chapters as far as possible. As I will explain in chapter 1 in more detail, Greece is sometimes included but more often excluded in historical work covering Central, East and South-East Europe. Excluding the country often was a consequence of its unique position in PREFACE xxii Preface South-East Europe during the Cold War, but this is not something which should bind us any longer today. Finally, I would like to thank my parents Prof. Dr. Peter and Ingrid Morys for the deep interest in Eastern Europe which they fostered in me early on. When I grew up in West Berlin (and later in Bavaria), they regularly took my siblings and me to East Berlin and East Germany; trips into an utterly diﬀerent and often very strange world, it seemed to me back then. Yet my parents always made clear to us that anything to the East of the Brandenburg Gate belonged to Europe as much as the lands to the West of it, and that Eastern Europe awaited exploration once the political circumstances allowed. I dedicate this book to them. The interwar period 1918–1939 Introduction The interwar period has typically received a negative assessment in economic his- tory (Kindleberger 1987, Eichengreen 1992, Feinstein et al. 2008). The 1920s are portrayed as an earnest and well-intentioned attempt by policy-makers to return to the benign economic environment of the pre-war era (free trade, gold standard, ﬁscal orthodoxy, etc.), and complement it with supportive international structures such as the League of Nations. Yet the legacy of World War I loomed large over the world economy, and political cooperation remained elusive after the divisions brought by the war and the subsequent Paris peace treaties. By the mid-1920s, an economic recovery had been achieved that was fragile in some places and buoy- ant in others (the “Roaring Twenties”), but the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 reversed the achievements of this quinquennium quickly. Output declined massively, often up to a third of gross domestic product (GDP), and the subse- quent recovery remained weak. Some countries were even unable to regain the late 1920s output level before the outbreak of World War II. The gold standard and the international trading system unravelled, and many governments defaulted on their debts. This perspective might be convincing, yet it largely reﬂects the experiences of the industrialised economies of North America and Western Europe, and arguably of two countries in particular. For the United States, the Great Depression consti- tuted the single most traumatic event of the 20th century; it acted as a watershed, much more so than the two world wars from which the United States emerged victorious with its mainland unharmed (Bordo et al. 1998). In the case of Europe, the Great Depression was particularly severe in Germany, contributing to the end of the Weimar Republic and the rise of Hitler. The Great Depression was, at least to a considerable degree, an industrial crisis, but this was not the world of Central, 7 ECONOMIC GROWTH AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN CENTRAL, EAST AND SOUTH\u0000EAST EUROPE 1918\u00001939 Matthias Morys 162 Matthias Morys East and South-East Europe (CESEE). Even by the 1930s, Czechoslovakia was the only country in the region that was properly industrialised (and hence suﬀered from the Great Depression more than any other country in Eastern Europe). Despite these fundamental structural diﬀerences between Western and Eastern Europe, most of the historiography (Berend  & Ránki 1982, Berend 1998) has supported a negative assessment of the interwar period also for the countries of Central Europe (Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland) and South-East Europe (Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania and Yugoslavia). This is the case in particu- lar for the inﬂuential works of Berend and Ránki (1974) and Kaser and Radice (1985–1989). Both works, which remain towering scholarly achievements and important reference points to this day, are carefully argued and are based on a wealth of quantitative and qualitative evidence. Yet there also is a sense that the critical assessment of the interwar achievements carries a subtext, namely to jus- tify, very subtly, the heavy state intervention, collectivisation of agriculture and forced industrialisation which materialised after World War II under communist regimes. The logic is that if neither the (relatively) liberal order of the 1920s nor the “light” state intervention of the 1930s had generated enough growth and structural change, then forms of government that were more intrusive seemed appropriate after the war. Such views were often held with great conviction by authors based in Eastern Europe (Berend, Ránki) or hailing from the region (7 of the 14 contributors to Kaser & Radice [1985–1989] were émigrés). Yet many academics in Western Europe and North America shared them in the 1970s and 1980s, even though they typically articulated them with greater nuance (e.g., Lampe & Jackson 1982). The literature referred to above typically did not draw on GDP and business cycle indicators, as is the standard case for interwar studies on the United States and Western Europe. It relied instead on a variety of easily available but less pertinent data such as trade, capital ﬂows, infrastructure spending and so forth. There was no conceptual hesitation to use GDP data; they were simply not available. At the time when Berend and Ránki (1974) and Kaser and Radice (1985–1989) wrote their monumental contributions, annual national accounts were available only for three countries (Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia). Due to intensive quantitative research eﬀorts of the past two decades, we are today in a far better position to analyse economic growth and structural change for the CESEE countries in the interwar period. Thanks to Markevich and Harrison (2011), we possess annual GDP data for the early Soviet Union, by far the largest economy in the region. Ivanov’s (2012) national accounts for Bulgaria allow us to better understand the economic development of a country that is widely seen as particularly backward (in the European context) and has fascinated economic historians since the seminal works of Alexander Gerschenkron (1962). Finally, our improved knowledge of interwar Greece (Mazower 1991, Christodoulaki 2001, Kostelenos et al. 2007) puts the CESEE interwar experience into perspective, as Greece was the only country in the region not to undergo the state socialist expe- rience after World War II. The country can serve as counterfactual experiment: Economic growth and structural change 163 how would neighbouring countries have developed after 1945 with a capitalist economy? The result of such a reassessment is surprisingly positive. Economic growth rates of the CESEE countries were high, both vis-à-vis other European coun- tries and compared to their own past performance. As opposed to the 1870–1913 period, the CESEE economies began to converge on the Western European core economies led by Britain, France and Germany, and they did so more quickly than the Southern European economies (Italy, Portugal and Spain). All economies in the region moved away from the Gerschenkronian stereotype of backward peasant economies. In most cases, this implied far-reaching structural change. Hungary and Greece, for instance, had a meaningful industrial sector by the late 1930s. But even where structural change did not happen, as in Bulgaria for instance, improvements in agriculture were of such magnitude that per capita incomes and living standards rose substantially. The positive reassessment of the Central and South-East European experience puts in perspective the economic achievements and shortcomings of the early Soviet Union. On one level, the Soviet Union became part of the European con- vergence club very similar to the other countries described in this chapter. The country grew neither quickly nor slowly in a regional or European comparative framework but in line with what convergence forces would suggest. Yet on many other levels, the Soviet Union stood apart. After the devastations of World War I and the Russian Civil War (1918–1921) and (some form of) economic recov- ery under the relatively market-friendly New Economic Policy (1921–1928), the Soviet Union became the ﬁrst country worldwide to move to a strategy of forced industrialisation. The collectivisation of agriculture and the complete nationalisa- tion of industry (nationalisation had been limited to the “commanding heights” of the economy such as large-scale industry and commercial banks until 1928) brought the entire economy under the control of the Soviet government which henceforth directed the economy with the help of Five-Year Plans. Government ﬁat (and force) replaced the market, and the new economic policies became depen- dent on a totalitarian political system for their implementation. This strategy was controversial at the time and has remained so ever since. Was there long-run gain at the expense of short-term pain? The bulk of the evidence presented in this chapter suggests that fundamental structural change took place elsewhere in the region under market-based economic systems, and it calls into question the idea that the Soviet approach was the only option available to transform the Russian economy (Allen 2003). The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows. Section 2 will describe the national accounts available for the 12 CESEE countries. Section 3 will anal- yse GDP, population and GDP per capita developments in the interwar period, partly based on summary statistics and partly on the concept of convergence. We will argue that convergence with Western Europe happened, albeit at diﬀerent speeds in the various countries. Section 4 is devoted to explaining what section 3 documents: Did the high growth rates emanate in the primary sector (agriculture, 164 Matthias Morys ﬁshing, forestry) or the secondary sector (large-scale and small-scale industry, con- struction)? What explains agricultural productivity increases and the emergence of small-scale industries in most countries? The evidence presented will allow to distinguish three distinct development paths which match, albeit imperfectly, the sub-regions of Central Europe (structural change based on light industries), South- Eastern Europe (little structural change but vast improvements in agriculture) and Eastern Europe/Soviet Union (forced structural change focused on heavy indus- tries). Section 5 summarises and concludes.2 The interwar national accounts of the CESEE countriesFor our data on GDP, population and GDP per capita we rely mostly on the data set provided by Maddison (2009) and partly revised by Mad- dison (2013; see Bolt & van Zanden 2014 for the changes introduced). The most recent update of this database (Maddison 2018; see Bolt et al. 2018 for the latest revisions) has not resulted in any changes for the CESEE countries. Maddison (2009, 2013, 2018) go back to Maddison (2006), which contains detailed descrip- tions of the underlying sources. While oﬀering a uniﬁed data set standardised at 1990 Geary-Khamis US dollars (in line with the other three growth chapters in this volume), it is worth elaborating on the input series. In broad terms, the data for the Soviet Union, Bulgaria and Greece reﬂect recent research eﬀorts, while the time series for Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia and Poland go back to the 1950s and 1960s. The data for Romania, the Baltic countries and Albania are either problematic or completely absent, and we exclude them from further analysis after a brief description below. For Russia and the Soviet Union, the 2013 update of the Maddison database oﬀers, for the ﬁrst time, a continuous annual time series for the period 1885–1940. Building on earlier work by Gregory (1982) for the late Tsarist economy and Moorsteen and Powell (1966) for Soviet industrialisation 1928–1940 (Maddison 2006: 471), the more recent GDP reconstruction by Markevich and Harrison (2011) covering World War I, the Russian Civil War (1918–1921) and the period of the New Economic Policy (1921–1928) is employed to connect the two time series. Assessing the region’s largest economy is therefore much easier today than it was only a decade ago. The GDP data for Bulgaria has seen similar improvements in recent years. The older data by Chakalov (1946) has been replaced by Ivanov and Tooze (2007) for the interwar period, but it remains conﬁned to benchmark years and contains annual data only for 1924–1945. Ivanov (2012) subsequently provided annual data stretching back to 1870. These data, while widely used (cf. Chapter 3 by Kopsi- dis & Schulze), have not yet made it into the Maddison data set (including its 2018 update). The situation of the GDP data for Greece is more complicated. The GDP reconstructions for 1830–1939 by Kostelenos (1995) and Kostelenos et al. (2007) have struggled to ﬁnd widespread acceptance. Maddison initially did not use them at all (see Maddison 2006: 407 for a detailed discussion of Kostelenos 1995), but has used them since the 2013 update for the pre-WWI period for the lack of com- parable annual data. Other authors, such as Kopsidis and Schulze (Chapter 3), draw Economic growth and structural change 165 on key components of Kostelenos’s work but then manipulate the data in diﬀerent ways. The resulting GDP series are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, with Kostelenos oﬀering a more pessimistic assessment of the pre-WWI economic development than Kop- sidis and Schulze. Maddison (2013) does not use Kostelenos for the interwar period but links instead three diﬀerent estimates, carried out between 1954 and 1960, to obtain a uniﬁed series for the interwar period (Maddison 2006: 407). Diﬀerent from the other ﬁve countries studied in detail in this chapter, the sources underlying Maddison (2006, 2009, 2013, 2018) for the case of Greece do not contain data on sectoral shares (Clark 1957, Ekonomikos Tachydromos 1954). We established the shares for 1921, 1929 and 1938 in Table 7.5 as follows. We use the 1913 shares provided by Kopsidis and Schulze in Chapter 3 for 1921 (59.1%, 19.4% and 21.5%, respectively), as we know that the occupational structure in Greece hardly changed between 1910 and 1920 (Lampe  & Jackson 1982: 336, Clark 1951: 399). We then estimate the increasing secondary sector share of total output by comparing the industrial production index of Christodoulaki (2001) with overall GDP growth. Such comparison suggests a secondary sector share of 24.9% in 1929 and 25.8% in 1938. Christodoulaki’s (2001) industrial produc- tion index constitutes the most recent research eﬀort and implies lower industrial growth than the contemporary estimate of Greece’s Supreme Economic Council and the later estimate by Mazower (1991) (for details cf. Christodoulaki 1991: 64). Christodoulaki’s (2001) industrial production series shows growth of industry to be lower than growth of the secondary sector as a whole (the latter data are conﬁned to 1925–1938 and hence cannot be used for our purposes). Consequently, our estimate produces by design a lower-bound estimate of advances of the secondary sector in the interwar period. The interwar GDP data for Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia are annual (only Hungary misses the entries for 1921–1923) and have seen no major revisions since the key contributions by Pryor et  al. (1971) for Czechoslovakia, Eckstein (1955) for Hungary and Vinski (1961) for Yugoslavia. These GDP reconstructions emerged at the time in the broader context of Thad P. Alton’s Research Project on National Income in East Central Europe. Alton aimed at calculating GDP for the Soviet bloc economies during the Cold War period (cf. Chapter 11 by Vonyó & Markevich), yet his work inspired research on where the CESEE economies stood in the decades before the introduction of the command economy. Interwar data for the other six CESEE countries are either problematic (Poland, Romania and Estonia) or completely absent (Albania, Latvia and Lithuania). Annual GDP data for Poland are available only for 1929–1938 based on the work by Laski (1956). Little insight can be gained from such a short time series and we do not include Poland as a result. The case of Romania is more complicated. Axenciuc (2012) provides annual GDP data since 1862 in domestic currency; a series deemed of good quality for the pre-WWI period and used, among others, by Kopsidis and Schulze in Chapter 3. Maddison (2018) incorporates the Axenciuc data, but his conversion into 1990 USD diﬀers widely from the values calculated by Kop- sidis and Schulze. The value for 1913, for instance, is only a quarter of the value 166 Matthias Morys reported by Kopsidis and Schulze (481 vs. 1705). Likewise, the 1937 value is only a third of the value reported by Broadberry and Klein (2012: 88; 450 vs. 1206). Common to all series available for Romania is a fall in GDP per capita compar- ing 1913 with 1937/38, a ﬁnding we consider implausible even when taking into account the sizeable border changes after World War I. Furthermore, such a fall in GDP per capita is also diﬃcult to reconcile with other, more positive accounts of the Romanian interwar economy (Lampe & Jackson 1982, Turnock 1986, Kop- sidis & Ivanov 2017a). Erring on the side of caution, we exclude Romania from our analysis. There are some GDP data available for Estonia (Klesment 2010: 179), but the underlying source from Valge (2003) is in Estonian and, to the best of our knowledge, has received little international scrutiny. We exclude Estonia from our analysis, even though the available data suggest high levels of GDP per capita. The country constitutes an interesting case for future research. GDP data for interwar Albania are conﬁned to a single benchmark estimate for 1929 based on GDP proxy estimates by Good and Ma (1999). This one observa- tion can only reveal that Albania was the poorest CESEE economy during the interwar period. There are no GDP data available for Latvia and Lithuania. Excluding Albania, the Baltic countries, Poland and Romania from our analysis is most unfortunate. Available economic and social indicators suggest that Albania and the Baltic countries constituted the lower and the upper end of CESEE inter- war economic development, respectively (see Chapter 10 of this book). Likewise, it must remain open for the time being whether the positive assessment of the pre- WWI Romanian economy by Kopsidis and Schulze in Chapter 3 would ﬁnd its counterpart in the interwar years. Finally, we can answer the interesting question to what extent Poland beneﬁtted economically from the Westward shift after World War II only once we have more robust data available for the interwar period. Quantitative dimensions of economic growth Tables  7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 provide data on GDP, population and GDP per capita for the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece and Yugoslavia. GDP levels and population numbers suggest that the Soviet Union was larger than Central Europe and South-East Europe combined. This is true, even if including the missing six countries (of which only Poland and Romania had sizeable popula- tions, approximately 34.8 million and 19.8 million, respectively, by the end of the period). A major problem for any study of the interwar period is its brevity. We are ana- lysing a maximum of four business cycles (Morys & Ivanov 2015) as opposed to four decades for the state socialist period (Chapter 11) and an even longer period for the long 19th century (Chapter 3). What, then, are the natural boundaries of the interwar period? We choose 1921 as the ﬁrst year for which GDP data are available for all six countries. That year coincides with the end of the Russian Civil War (1918–1921) and precedes the end of the Greco-Turkish War (1918–1922) by one year (ﬁghting Economic growth and structural change 167 TABLE 7.1 GDP: levels and growth rates in six CESEE countries, 1913–1938 Eastern Europe Central Europe South-East Europe Soviet Union Czecho- slovakia Hungary Bulgaria 3 Greece Yugoslavia 3 Levels (in millions 1990 USD) 1913 220,852 3 27,755 14,700 3 5,218 5 7,900 3 13,223 1921 80,394 3 27,117 13,585 4 5,150 11,196 12,093 1929 231,886 1 42,240 21,250 7,851 6 14,696 17,822 1938 405,220 41,578 2 24,342 9,833 18,901 20,083 Growth rates p.a.

This year is also close to, or even coincides with, the year in which countries regained their 1913 income levels (Tables 7.1 and 7.3, lower panel). The only exception was the Soviet Union, where the devastations of World War I  and the subsequent Civil War were such that income levels had fallen by 1921 to approximately a third of their 1913 values (i.e., levels which were recovered only at the end of the decade). Consequently, 1921 would lead to inﬂated growth rates in the case of the Soviet Union, and selecting 1913 as reference point provides a more realistic perspective. Choosing more than one starting point for an analysis of interwar economic growth is not unusual, in which case authors typically select 1913 and 1921 (Feinstein et al. 2008: 10). We choose 1938 as the last year unaﬀected by World War II, again in line with widespread practice for the interwar period (Feinstein et al. 2008: 10). Yet we note that with the exception of Czechoslovakia (last data point for 1937) and Greece, Economic growth and structural change 169 TABLE 7.3 GDP per capita: levels and growth rates in six CESEE countries, 1913–1938 Eastern Europe Central Europe South-East Europe Soviet Union Czecho- slovakia Hungary Bulgaria Greece Yugoslavia Levels (in 1990 USD) 1913 1414 2096 18753 1137 5 1455 3 973 1921 526 2085 17094 1000 1918 959 1929 1370 1 3042 2476 1285 6 2342 1256 1938 2150 2882 2 2655 1499 2677 1249 Growth rates p.a.

Bulgaria, for instance, grew for eight consecutive years between 1932 (trough) and 1940 (peak). We found the following compromise: we maintain 1938 for the cal- culation of growth rates (Tables 7.1 and 7.3, middle panel), but show separately the (annualised) growth rate from the Great Depression trough to the late 1930s peak (Tables 7.1 and 7.3, lower panel). We will return to this point when discussing the strength (and length) of recovery growth after the Great Depression. Long-run growth analysis The CESEE economies grew between 2.7% p.a. (Czechoslovakia) and 3.9% p.a. (Bulgaria) between 1921 and 1938 (Table  7.1). Even when extending the time frame to the quarter century of 1913–1938, growth rates fall in an elevated range between 1.7% (Czechoslovakia) and 3.6% (Greece). In this perspective, which we adopt to capture more adequately the experience of the Soviet Union (cf. above), the Soviet Union occupies an intermediate position (2.5%). GDP growth translates into GDP per capita growth of the same magnitude only if the population remains unchanged. Yet population grew in all cases, with CESEE essentially falling into two diﬀerent groups (Table 7.2; cf. Chapter 10 for details): countries experiencing a late demographic transition with high population growth throughout the interwar period (Soviet Union, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia in our sample) and the more advanced economies of the region, which had already transitioned to a new demographic equilibrium characterised by low population growth (Czechoslovakia and Hungary in our sample). Consequently, growth rates of GDP per capita are lower than of GDP in all cases, yet by a wider margin for countries experiencing a late demographic transition. Based on the 1921–1938 time frame, all countries bar Yugoslavia experienced per capita increases of 2% p.a. and more (Table 7.3). This makes CESEE the fast- est growing world region of the interwar period, as a comparison with Western Europe, the United States, Latin America, Japan, China and India for precisely the same period presented in Feinstein et al. (2008: 10) shows. Yet it could be argued that any positive re-assessment of the interwar period is valid only if based on GDP per capita growth for the 1913–1938 period, as results are biased downwards by including the years of zero (or even negative) growth associated with World War I. In this perspective, the countries growing slowest still achieved growth of 1.0% per capita (Bulgaria, Yugoslavia), and the other four countries achieved values between 1.3% (Czechoslovakia) and 2.5% (Greece), with Hungary (1.4%) and the Soviet Union (1.7%) falling in between. Are such values high or low? There are two points of comparison: a country’s own past performance and the contemporaneous performance of other econo- mies. The second perspective will lead to a convergence framework, drawing on the interwar growth experience of 18 European countries (see below). In the fol- lowing, we compare our ﬁndings with the 1870–1913 period studied by Kopsidis and Schulze in Chapter 3. From the six economies they study (Austria, Bulgaria, Economic growth and structural change 171 Greece, Hungary, Romania and Russia), they show that only Hungary (1.3%) and Romania (1.5%) saw GDP per capita growth of more than 1.0% (Table 3.3). Russia’s and Bulgaria’s per head income levels hardly grew at all (0.6% and 0.1%, respectively). Before World War I, limited advances of per capita income reﬂected strong population growth, yet even switching to GDP does not alter the main ﬁnding that growth rates increased after the war. GDP growth rates 1913–1938 consistently exceed GDP growth rates 1870–1913 (Table 3.1), in some cases by as much as one percentage point and more (Bulgaria: 2.4% vs. 1.4%; Greece: 3.6% vs. 2.2%). In sum, CESEE grew more quickly in the interwar period than the 1870–1913 period, running against a widespread perception that equates the ﬁrst age of globalisation with strong economic growth while identifying the interwar period with economic failure. Short-run growth analysis: the 1920s Most accounts of the interwar period distinguish two periods separated by the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 (Kindleberger 1987, Eichengreen 1992, Feinstein et al. 2008): “the 1920s,” that is the recovery period after World War I, followed by a business cycle upswing and stronger economic growth in 1924–1929 (the latter half often referred to as the “Roaring Twenties”); and “the 1930s,” that is from the onset of the Great Depression to the outbreak of World War II. Such a chronology ﬁts well Central Europe and South-East Europe, where four out of ﬁve countries reached their late 1920s business cycle peak in 1929 (cf. Tables 7.1 and 7.3, lower panel; Bulgaria reached its peak in 1931). Can we integrate the Soviet Union into such a chronological framework? Due to its autarky policies, the Soviet Union was one of the few economies worldwide that was not negatively aﬀected by the Great Depression. Yet 1928 acted as a turn- ing point for the Soviet Union no less fundamental than 1929 for the capitalist economies. In this year, Stalin terminated the New Economic Policy which had served the country well in terms of economic recovery (the 1913 GDP level was recovered in 1928; cf. Table  7.1), but was increasingly seen as incompatible with the political and economic agenda of the Soviet leadership (see Chapters 8 and 12 of this book). Born out of sheer necessity in 1921, the New Economic Policy had reintroduced a considerable amount of “capitalism” after the so-called War Communism between 1918 and 1921. Farmers owned their lands and were no longer subject to draco- nian wartime requisitioning targets, private trade was legalised, and small enter- prises were exempted from nationalisation, among many other measures aimed at reviving private initiative. In particular, the New Economic Policy had empowered the peasants to an extent that they became viewed as a threat to the political leader- ship or, at least, as an obstacle to rapid industrialisation. Recognising this inherent tension, Stalin terminated the New Economic Policy in 1928 and embarked on a policy of “forced industrialisation,” which today is associated with the early phases of the state socialist experience (see Chapter 11). 172 Matthias Morys All Central and South-East European economies grew more quickly in the 1920s than in the 1930s. Czechoslovakia and Hungary grew particularly strongly (GDP per capita growth above 4%), with Yugoslavia slightly behind at 3.4%. Bul- garia’s and Greece’s per head income levels also grew quickly, at 2.5% p.a. By any measure, the 1920s were a period of high economic growth in which countries quickly recovered from World War I (1913 income levels were recovered on aver- age by 1923) and then grew substantially in the business cycle upswing of the sec- ond half of the 1920s (Morys & Ivanov 2015). The Soviet Union needed a full decade to recover from World War I, the Civil War and the 1921–1922 famine (approx. 6 million deaths). Crucially, and distinct from the other CESEE economies, the Soviet Union did not “develop” in the 1920s. The New Economic Policy provided the country with the opportunity to return to where it had stood in 1913; most of the growth came from the exploi- tation of unused capacity in industry rather than the build-up of new industries (Markevich & Harrison 2011: 688). This perspective is supported by the sectoral composition of the Soviet economy, which was almost identical comparing 1913 and 1928 (Table 7.5). It has remained the subject of scholarly debate if the con- tinuation of the New Economic Policy beyond 1928 could have delivered genuine industrialisation (Allen 2003) or not (Markevich & Harrison 2011), but there is agreement that by the time it was abandoned it had not proceeded beyond the achievements of the late Tsarist economy. At the time, Soviet policy-makers cer- tainly perceived such a limitation of the New Economic Policy, tipping the balance in favour of a strategy of forced industrialisation after 1928 (cf. chapter 8). Short-run growth analysis: the 1930s The 1930s saw a reversal of fortunes between the Soviet Union and the other ﬁve countries. The Soviet Union exhibited high growth rates under the ﬁrst two Five-Year Plans, growing at 5.7% p.a. Yet these policies came at enormous human cost. The col- lectivisation of agriculture (and the associated grain delivery targets) was a vital pillar, as it ensured the necessary resource transfer from the countryside to the cities (and the industries located in them). But resistance of the farming population (about 80% of total population) to the expropriation of their homesteads resulted in a vicious circle of peasants hoarding food (which was then sold on the black market) and violent coun- termeasures by the state, contributing – or even leading to – the 1932–1933 famine with an estimated 6 million deaths. For those who survived the 1930s (Stalin’s Great Terror of 1937–1938 resulted in another 1 million deaths), living standard increases were far more modest than an annual per capita growth rate of 4.6% suggests. The latest research suggests that living standards in the 1930s did not rise at all and arguably even fell (Allen 1998, Allen & Khaustova 2019; cf. Chapter 10 for details). In Central Europe and South-East Europe, growth slowed after the onset of the Great Depression. Countries growing rapidly in the 1920s (Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia) experienced a strong slowdown. By contrast, Greece and Bulgaria continued to grow at some pace in the 1930s, with less than a 1% growth diﬀer- ence between the 1920s and the 1930s. As the next section will explore in detail, Economic growth and structural change 173 the diﬀerent fortunes between Czechoslovakia and Hungary, on the one hand, and Bulgaria and Greece, on the other, relate to the sectoral structure of the economies. Industrialised Czechoslovakia and industrialising Hungary beneﬁtted more strongly from the global recovery of the 1920s but suﬀered more from the Great Depression as industrial crisis (Klein et al. 2017). By contrast, growth in Bulgaria and Greece relied mostly on productivity increases in the agricultural sector. As such changes were of a domestic nature, the Great Depression had a smaller impact on South-East Europe. Greece and Bulgaria are also noteworthy for a short Great Depression: they reached their cyclical troughs in 1931 and 1932, respectively, and recovered the level of the previous business cycle peak (Greece: 1929; Bulgaria: 1931) by 1933. From a business cycle perspective, the Great Depression in Greece and Bulgaria only lasted four and two years, respectively. Hungary and Yugoslavia reached their troughs also as early as 1932, but their recoveries took longer. Czechoslovakia – incidentally the most industrialised CESEE economy  – stands out as the only country that did not recover its 1929 GDP per capita level in the interwar period. An intriguing feature in all cases is the strength and the length of the recovery. Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary and Yugoslavia experienced seven to eight year-long uninterrupted growth periods, in which the economies grew at annualised rates between 4.7% and 5.1%. CESEE in a pan-European convergence framework The summary statistics in Tables  7.1 and 7.3 suggest that the CESEE countries grew rapidly in the interwar period compared to their own past performance. Did they also grow faster than the more advanced economies at the time, allowing them to catch up in the process? In the following, we will establish whether the CESEE countries converged on the European core economies, namely the three populous countries of Britain, France and Germany and the smaller yet no less developed economies of Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The convergence hypothesis states that poor economies will tend to catch up with and grow faster than rich ones, with all economies converging eventually in terms of per capita income. 1 Low-income countries have the potential to grow faster than more developed, richer countries because they are not faced with as rapidly diminishing returns to capital accumulation as high-income and capital-intensive economies. In addition, poor economies can adopt and adapt the technologies, pro- duction methods and institutions that are characteristic of the leading, rich econo- mies. Crucially, initial diﬀerences in income levels and/or capital stock only create a catch-up potential; exploiting this potential is another matter, and the exact conditions for doing so have remained controversial (Abramovitz 1986). A vast body of empiri- cal research suggests that some periods exhibit stronger convergence forces than oth- ers, a ﬁnding replicated in Chapters 3 and 11 of this book on the long 19th century (weak convergence) and the state socialist period (strong convergence), respectively. Was the interwar period characterised by convergence or by divergence forces? Table 7.4 oﬀers a preliminary answer by providing income levels and growth rates for four distinct European regions: (1) the six CESEE economies; (2) the Western 174 Matthias Morys European core (as mentioned above, Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland); (3) the four Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden); and (4) Southern Europe (Italy and Portugal). We exclude Spain from our analysis, as the GDP collapse due to the Spanish Civil War (1936– 1939) might otherwise bias our results against Southern Europe. This sample of 18 countries includes all European economies with reliable annual data except for Austria and Ireland, two small economies which escape our regional classiﬁcation. Table  7.4 constructs per head income levels for each of the four European regions (ﬁrst panel) by aggregating country-speciﬁc data on GDP (third panel) and on population (not shown) and dividing them. It also gives regional growth rates of GDP per capita (second panel) and of GDP (fourth panel) for 1913–1938, 1921–1938, 1921–1929 and 1929–1938. The columns of Table  7.4 list regions in descending order of regional per head income level, namely Western Europe, Northern Europe, Southern Europe and CESEE. In the case of the six CESEE economies, the unique experience of the Soviet Union suggests to provide data for Central Europe and South-East Europe on its own (column 5: ﬁve countries) and for the CESEE region as a whole (column 6: six countries). In parentheses we provide regional per head income levels relative to Western Europe. On balance, convergence forces dominated the interwar period. Northern Europe and CESEE reduced their income gap to the core between 1913 and 1938, while Southern Europe’s gap widened only marginally. GDP per capita growth in CESEE compared to Western Europe was higher by 0.6% p.a., shrinking the per head income gap from 35.5% in 1913 to 41.8% in 1938. In terms of GDP, CESEE grew twice as rapidly: 1.2% for the core vs. 2.4% for the CESEE-6. Given the late demographic transition in large parts of CESEE (cf. Chapter 10 for details), GDP growth is arguably the more relevant point of comparison. On this bench- mark, the region grew more quickly not only over the full 1913–1938 period but also over each of the three sub-periods 1921–1938, 1921–1929 and 1929–1938. Results are not driven by the Soviet Union: the ﬁve Central and South-East Euro- pean economies grew annually by a full percentage point more (1.2% vs. 2.2%), and they grew faster (or at the same speed) for any of the sub-periods. Were convergence forces of diﬀerent magnitude in the various regions? The most basic variant of testing the (unconditional) convergence hypothesis involves regressing the GDP growth rate of a given period (1913–1938 in our case) on the initial income level at the start of the period (1913). Figure 7.1 shows the 18 observations of our sample and the implied regression line based on the following (statistically signiﬁcant) regression result: Growth rate1913–1938 = 99.3 − 0.011 × GDP per capita1913 (in percent) (t-value: 6.48) (t-value: −2.17) (in 1990 USD) Economic growth and structural change 175 TABLE 7.4 GDP per capita (levels and growth rates) and GDP (growth rates), 1913–1938, Central, East and South-East Europe versus Western, Northern and Southern Europe GDP per capita Western Europe 1 Northern Europe 1 Southern Europe 1 Central and South-East Europe 1 Central, East and South-East Europe 1 Belgium Britain France Germany Netherlands Switzerland Denmark Finland Norway Sweden Italy Portugal Czechoslovakia Hungary Bulgaria Greece Yugoslavia Czechoslovakia Hungary Soviet Union Bulgaria Greece Yugoslavia GDP per capita levels (in 1990 USD) In parentheses: levels relative to Western Europe 1913 4,067 2,912 (71.6%) 2,366 (58.2%) 1,548 (38.1%) 1,444 (35.5%) 1921 3,526 2,824 (80.1%) 2,156 (61.2%) 1,567 (44.4%) 761 (21.6%) 1929 4,771 3,898 (81.7%) 2,860 (59.9%) 2,114 (44.3%) 1,547 (32.4%) 1938 5,245 4,696 (89.5%) 2,922 (55.7%) 2,221 (42.3%) 2,165 (41.8%) GDP per capita growth rates p.a.

Note: 1 Regional averages are weighted by population. 176 Matthias Morys The inverse relationship between initial income and subsequent growth rate vindi- cates the convergence hypothesis: low-income economies were growing faster and catching up. The size of the slope means that for every USD (1990) 1,000 income diﬀerence in 1913, the richer economy is expected to grow by 11% less until 1938. With the exception of Italy, all peripheral countries converged on the core econo- mies. Yet the size of this eﬀect diﬀered between countries and regions. The Nordic countries grew strongly, and in particular they grew more strongly than convergence forced would suggest (as indicated by their position above the regression line). By contrast, the Southern European economies grew less strongly than expected. Bulgaria, the Soviet Union, Hungary and Czechoslovakia all lie very close to the regression line. Please note that the Soviet Union appears hardly any diﬀerent from the other three countries. Even though the country departed radically from conven- tional economic policy in the interwar period, the outcome in 1938 ﬁts the standard pattern of European economic development and convergence. The overperformance of the 1928–1938 period compensated for the underperformance of the 15  years preceding it. The forced industrialisation policies of Stalin, then, returned the coun- try to its long-run growth trajectory but failed to raise it above this threshold (in the same vein is Cheremukhin et al. 2017, albeit based on a very diﬀerent methodology).

We lack suﬃcient data on Yugoslav sectoral composition and industrial structure, and what is available often points in diﬀerent directions. Some of this probably reﬂects the extreme heterogeneity of a country with strong regional diﬀerences (Nikolić 2018). The Greek exception is easier to explain, and understanding the sectoral transformation during the interwar period will be key in doing so. This is what we turn to now. Sectoral transformation during the interwar period The previous section documented that the CESEE countries began to catch up with Western Europe during the interwar period. It also showed that economic growth in the early Soviet Union was not extraordinarily high, as some have claimed. Instead the country grew in line with what convergence forces would suggest given its 1913 income position. Yet the Soviet Union’s claim to fame does not necessarily rest on high growth rates. Apologists of Stalin’s forced industrialisa- tion policies, such as Allen (2003), argue that such policies constituted the best or even the only means to achieve structural change and catapult the Soviet economy into the industrial age. In this perspective, backward countries can get trapped in a vicious cycle, in which they export agricultural goods and return industrial goods in turn but fail to develop an industrial sector of their own as a consequence. Their comparative advantage in agriculture allows them to grow and prosper in the short and medium term but prevents structural change and hence long-run growth. Government intervention can help escape such a sub-optimal equilibrium. Col- lectivisation of agriculture enables the necessary resource transfer from the coun- tryside to the cities or, in the words of Allen (2003), from “farm to factory”; and the government can decide exactly what kind of industries they want to invest in. Some of this view is supported by the ﬁndings of Chapter  3 of this book, where Kopsidis and Schulze document “growth without structural change” for the CESEE economies for the 1870–1913 period, that is, a development path in which countries grow for extended periods of time without changing their economic structure. Did this pattern continue or change in the interwar period? Tables  7.5, 7.6 and 7.7 oﬀer diﬀerent yet related perspectives on structural change. Table  7.5 provides data on sectoral shares from 1900 to World War II. Table 7.6 shows annualised growth rates of the primary, secondary and tertiary sec- tor (columns 2–4) and their relative contribution to overall GDP growth (columns 6–8). Comparing sector growth to average annual GDP growth (column 5) shows if a particular sector grew faster or slower than the aggregate economy. The relative contribution to growth is measured as each sector’s growth rate (the full growth rate and not its annualised fraction as reported in columns 2–4), weighted by its share in GDP at the beginning of the period. The three values obtained are then scaled up so that they add up to 100. The diﬀerence between columns 2–4 and 6–8 may be illustrated with reference to Bulgaria. For the 1911–1939 period, the secondary sector grew more strongly (3.23% p.a.) than the primary sector (2.42%), yet its impact on overall growth remained limited (16.7%) as a result of its small 178 Matthias Morys share in 1911 (Table  7.5: 13.1%). Finally, Table  7.7 provides sectoral shares of the labour force. As labour productivity in agriculture was typically lower than in industry, labour shares put the continued importance of agriculture into sharper relief than sectoral shares. Hungary is a good case in point, where the primary sec- tor declined to 31.9% of GDP by 1939 but it continued to employ 50.0% of the country’s workforce. Table 7.6 demonstrates the structural shift achieved by the Soviet economy. Before 1914, more than 40% of growth had come from agriculture (Chapter 3, Table 3.5). In the interwar period, more than 40% came from industry, and the contribution of agriculture fell to 13%. At the end of the second Five-Year Plan in 1937, the second- ary sector overtook the primary sector by a small margin (32.3% vs. 31.0%). Yet the data presented in Tables 7.5 and 7.6 do not necessarily support the notion that structural change in the Soviet Union was contingent upon forced industri- alisation policies. Drawing on similar data for the 1870–1913 period (Chapter 3, Tables  3.5 and 3.6) suggests that longer-term forces of structural change were operating independent of the prevailing political and economic system. Every two decades, the Russian/Soviet economy added approximately 6% in the secondary sector: 13.6% (1870), 20.1% (1890), 26.0% (1913) and 32.2% (1937). This steady increase reﬂected a secondary sector, which grew about 2% p.a. more quickly than the primary sector, with little diﬀerence between the pre-war and the post-war periods: 2.13% for 1870–1913 versus 2.43% for 1913–1940. The Soviet Union might have provided as eﬃcient (or as ineﬃcient, for that matter) an environment for economic growth as the late Tsarist economy. While Allen has emphasised the Soviet contributions to growth and structural change, the more recent literature has reverted to more conventional views highlighting allocative ineﬃciencies typically associated with command economies. Castañeda Dower and Markevich (2018) and Cheremukhin et al. (2017), for instance, ﬁnd that the labour reallocation from agri- culture to industry under Stalin did not lead to an eﬃcient outcome and was infe- rior to what a market-based economic system would have generated. Cheremukhin et  al. (2017) make an even broader point. While acknowledging the structural transformation under Stalin, they ﬁnd, based on a neoclassical growth model, that productivity advances of both the agricultural and the industrial sectors would have been higher in the absence of the frictions associated with a command economy. A sceptical perspective on Stalin’s supposed economic success story ﬁnds sup- port in a comparison with Hungary. The country experienced even stronger structural change in the interwar period, yet remained within a conventional eco- nomic policy framework, that is, (relatively) liberal policies in the 1920s and a drift towards more interventionist but market-based policies in the 1930s. Hungary had a smaller secondary sector than Russia in the 1870–1913 period but then overtook the Soviet Union in the 1920s. By the outbreak of World War II, the secondary sector in both countries accounted for about 32% of GDP, higher than anywhere else in CESEE except for Czechoslovakia (35%). Hungarian secondary sector growth was similar to the Soviet Union (3.22% vs. 3.30%), and the relative contribution of the secondary sector to overall growth was even larger than in the Soviet case (47.1% vs. 40.4%).

Hungary and the Soviet Union both industrialised in the interwar period, but there was a fundamental diﬀerence: the Soviet Union invested in heavy industries whereas Hungary developed light industries. In the Soviet case, 56% of investment between 1929 and 1934 (the ﬁrst Five-Year Plan) went to metals, machinery, con- struction materials, chemicals and fuels, compared to only 8% for light industries 180 Matthias Morys TABLE 7.6 Sector growth and relative contributions to GDP growth in six CESEE countries, ca. 1913–1938 Sector growth (percent p.a.)

Note: 1 Numbers do not add up to 100 due to the peculiarity of the underlying source material. (Allen 2003: 95). By contrast, Hungary thrived on the light industries shunned by the Soviet Union. Agricultural processing (ﬂour milling, distilling of alcohol, sugar reﬁning, etc.) had been important since the late 19th century but expanded substan- tially after World War I (Klein et al. 2017: 70). The boom of the 1920s was largely propelled by the rapid development of the textile industry. The 1930s witnessed increased industrial activity in metal processing and engineering (partly related to 182 Matthias Morys rearmament), two business activities typically taking place in large-scale company structures. Yet even by 1941, the majority of the secondary sector workforce worked in small-scale companies of fewer than 20 workers (Eckstein 1955: 176–185). These diﬀerences can be explained by the respective economic environments. Hungary continued its market-based growth model, responding to shifts inside and outside of the country. The country had not industrialised before World War I but instead developed a highly productive, capital-intensive agriculture (Schulze 2000, 2007). The emergence of a food-processing industry in the interwar period was a natural next step. Similarly, the production of textiles as a labour-intensive, low-skill and small-scale industry suited well the country’s economic conditions. The rise of this particular industry followed a general trend by which low value-added industries moved from the core to the periphery in the interwar period (Kopsidis 2012: 7). An underlying assumption of the Hungarian growth model was trade and capital market integration with the rest of the world. There was no perceived need to produce capital- intensive goods, as they would continue to be imported from Western Europe. The Soviet Union had a much greater incentive to move into large-scale indus- try. As a large country with a vast domestic market, Russia had always been one of the least open economies of Europe (cf. Table 5.2 in Chapter 5). The autarky policies pursued since the early 1920s followed less a coherent economic agenda than political needs. The Soviet leadership had considered some form of military confrontation as inevitable since the Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War (Bushkovitch 2012: 371). Consequently, the Soviet Union needed to develop the full range of industries, including iron and steel, machine building and petroleum. Such considerations were not the only ones in the Soviet industrialisation debate between 1924 and 1928, but they were an important ingredient (Elrich 1960). The Soviet Union simply could not content itself with food processing and textile industries, which constituted the most important manufacturing activities in Hun- gary and all South-East European countries (Kopsidis & Ivanov 2017a). The Hungarian experience demonstrates that CESEE countries could industrialise within a conventional economic policy framework. In concession to the important arguments in favour of forced industrialisation advanced by Allen (2003), it is important to note that a conventional policy framework did not necessarily lead to industrialisa- tion. Growth without structural change remained a distinct possibility. This experience is best exempliﬁed by Bulgaria. The country underwent hardly any structural change between 1870 and 1939. The secondary sector accounted for 14.9% in 1870, 14.6% in 1900 and 15.0% in 1939. Consequently, the relative contribution of the secondary sector to overall growth was small and accounted consistently for less than 20%. Bulgaria grew in the interwar period by developing a more productive agri- cultural sector. The country moved away from extensiﬁcation of agriculture (the pre-1914 pattern by which new land was put to agricultural use) to intensiﬁcation (improving the productivity of a given plot of land). Given the relative poverty of the peasants and the delicate budget situation of the government, only very lim- ited private and public funds were available to increase investment into agriculture (e.g., for the purpose of installing irrigation systems or building dams). Farming remained labour intensive, but an important process of “low-cost modernisation” Economic growth and structural change 183 (Ivanov  & Tooze 2007, Kopsidis  & Ivanov 2017b) took place in which farmers increased agricultural productivity by, among others, improving seed varieties or using chemical fertilisers more widely. The result was impressive, as shown by pri- mary sector growth of 4.4% p.a. for two decades. Agricultural modernisation was not limited to Bulgaria. The agricultural sector continued to grow in all CESEE economies and make a sizeable contribution to total GDP growth (Table 7.6, with the notable exception of Hungary). Even Sta- lin’s rapid industrialisation of 1928–1940 was accompanied – and made possible – by primary sector growth of 1.9% p.a. This ﬁnding is very diﬀerent from earlier literature which had identiﬁed many of the region’s interwar economic problems in a stagnant agricultural sector (Berend 1985). Hungary and Bulgaria stand for two diﬀerent growth models. Hungary saw hardly any growth of agriculture, but it moved decisively into small-scale industries. Bulgaria, incidentally, moved into the same small-scale industries. Food processing accounted for 47% and textiles and clothing for 29% of Bulgarian manufacturing output in 1938 (Kopsidis & Ivanov 2017). Yet Bulgaria’s secondary sector growth started from a small basis in the early 1920s and did not leave much impact on the aggregate level. The country grew instead by an intensiﬁcation of its agricultural sector. We leave explaining the precise reasons for the two diﬀerent trajectories for future research, but the broad pattern seems clear. In the interwar period, each country moved one step ahead on its development path. Bulgaria moved from an extensiﬁcation of agriculture to an intensiﬁcation. Hungary, which was richer and more developed in 1913 (cf. Chapter 3), moved from agriculture into industry. In both cases, the result was substantial GDP per capita increases. The dichotomy between Bulgaria and Hungary helps understand the case of Greece, the CESEE country with the best interwar growth performance (Figure 7.1). Before World War I, the country stood between Hungary and Bulgaria on many economic indicators (cf. Chapter 3). Its agriculture was less developed than Hungary’s, but it had a larger manufacturing sector than Bulgaria. In the interwar period, Greece combined the strengths of both models. It experienced “Bulgarian” agricultural growth and “Hungar- ian” industrial growth. Nowhere else in CESEE was the contribution of the primary and the secondary to overall growth as evenly balanced as in the case of Greece (Table 7.6). Conclusions This chapter has reviewed economic growth and structural change of Central, East and South-East Europe in the interwar period. We began by sketching out the dominant view in the literature, a mostly skeptical assessment of economic growth in the region. This well-rehearsed narrative draws on similar accounts for Western Europe and the United States but fails to ask to what extent they can be applied to the Eastern European experience. The negative account emerged in the 1970s and 1980s and was strongly pushed by economic historians based in Eastern Europe and émigrés hailing from the region. It often served a speciﬁc purpose, that is to draw on the supposed failure of markets in the 1930s as a justiﬁcation for the heavily interventionist policies of state socialism after World War II. 184 Matthias Morys We then provided a more positive assessment of the interwar period, largely based on data for six CESEE economies for GDP, population, GDP per capita and indica- tors of structural change. Many of these data had not been available when the inﬂu- ential accounts of the 1970s and 1980s were written. The new data show the growth performance was considerably better than once thought. The CESEE economies not only grew more quickly in the interwar period than during the 1870–1913 globalisation period, but they also performed better than the Western European core economies. They grew twice as strongly (2.4% vs. 1.2%) between 1913 and 1938, allowing them to catch up (on a per capita basis) from 35.5% of Western European levels to 41.8% by the outbreak of World War II. CESEE remained the poorest region of Europe, but it had joined the European convergence club. The 1920s in particular showed strong growth, mainly concentrated in the sec- ond half of the decade. The earlier reconstruction eﬀorts bore fruit and the region experienced its own version of the “Roaring Twenties.” We also reassessed the impact of the Great Depression. The GDP declines in the (still largely agricultural) CESEE economies were much smaller than for their Western European counter- parts, and the recessions were typically short. The only exception was Czechoslo- vakia which, as the region’s most industralised economy, was heavily aﬀected by the Great Depression. A common feature of all CESEE economies was strong recovery growth after the Great Depression, above 4% p.a. in all cases and typically lasting seven to eight years. The length and the strength of this post–Great Depression growth became a deﬁning feature of the CESEE experience and explains why they converged on Western European income levels. Special attention was paid to the Sonderweg taken by the Soviet Union, the ﬁrst country worldwide to develop the characteristic features of state socialism: central planning, collectivisation of agriculture and forced industrialisation focused on heavy industries. From a pure national accounting point of view, the new strategy worked well: no country in the region grew as rapidly as the Soviet Union after 1928, when Stalin terminated the market-friendly New Economic Policy and launched a ﬁrst Five-Year Plan. In a longer-term perspective, however, a great deal of the over- performance between 1928 and 1938 was owed to the underperformance of the 1913–1928 period when the economy had hardly grown at all. A pan-European convergence framework showed that the Soviet Union in 1938 stood, in terms of per head income, almost exactly where convergence forces would suggest. We then tested the second line of defense of the apologists of Stalin’s forced indus- trialisation policies: was the Soviet approach better at achieving structural change and catapulting the economy into the industrial age? Structural change progressed unevenly in Central Europe and South-East Europe in the interwar period. Bul- garia, for instance, grew rapidly by increasing agricultural productivity. The country also industrialised to a certain extent, specialising in food production and textiles as so many other countries in the region. Yet as a share of GDP, the secondary sector hardly grew and remained below 20%. Further to the west and with better access to Western Europe, the experience was diﬀerent. Hungary, for instance, saw a struc- tural shift out of agriculture and into industry larger than the Soviet Union. The main diﬀerence between the two countries was not the degree of structural change Economic growth and structural change 185 but which particular industries they developed. Hungary developed light indus- tries in the 1920s and only the 1930s saw a larger move into metal processing and machinery built around large-scale industries. The Soviet Union, under govern- ment ﬁat (and force) and partly driven by a perceived need for national defense, was able to largely bypass the light-industries stage and move immediately into heavy industries such as iron and steel production, chemicals and petroleum. The data available for the six countries covered in this chapter suggest that there were essentially three distinct growth models: (1) a “South-East European” growth model epitomised by Bulgaria, where rapid growth stemmed from improv- ing agriculture; (2) a growth model typical of the more advanced Central European economies and exempliﬁed by Hungary, a country which experienced substantial structural change, initially focused on low-skill, labour-intensive light industries and only later venturing into heavy industry; and (3) the Soviet Union, with forced structural change geared towards heavy industries. Only future research can show if this typology is also helpful in explaining the Polish and the Romanian experiences and the smaller (yet no less interesting) cases of Albania and the Baltic countries. Note 1 In its “unconditional” or “absolute” form, the convergence hypothesis implies that income per capita diﬀerentials between economies will disappear in the long run. The “conditional” convergence hypothesis, on the other hand, also takes account of econo- mies’ diﬀerent structural characteristics (and not just initial income diﬀerentials). Here the implication is that an economy’s income per capita (or per worker) converges to a long- run level that is speciﬁc to this economy and determined by its structural features.

But the economic policies varied greatly, depending on economic factors as well as political and cultural traditions. To understand the speciﬁc experiences of Eastern European countries, one has to take three char- acteristics into account. First, with the exception of Austria and Czechoslovakia, the CESEE countries were much poorer and more agrarian than Western Europe. Thus the question of how to modernise the economy was much more salient for the East than for the West and, with the exception of the Soviet Union, involved the import of capital denominated in gold and foreign currencies, which created additional constraints. Second, nearly all CESEE countries were newly formed, enlarged, or curtailed after the First World War, while most Western European countries had been consolidated within their national borders for a longer period of time. CESEE countries were thus forced to direct great eﬀorts towards forming a stable national economy and society and coping with population exchanges and minority issues. Third, nearly all CESEE countries shifted from liberal democracies to authoritarian regimes. In one country, Russia, the period even witnessed the emergence of a totalitarian state, with terror and mass murder being an integral part of the industrialisation strategy. Given the speciﬁc conditions, the economic policies of the CESEE countries were geared towards building institutions, modernising the economy, and miti- gating economic and political vulnerabilities. With the exception of the Soviet Union, they went through four phases between 1918 and 1939. In the immediate aftermath of the First World War, governments focused on relief and reconstruc- tion, that is on reorganising trade relations, setting up a taxation system and a central bank, reducing inﬂation and stabilising the currency, bringing ﬁscal deﬁcits Economic policy, 1918–1939 189 under control, integrating former alien goods, and in some cases, implementing agrarian reforms. In the second half of the 1920s CESEE countries focussed on fostering growth by importing foreign capital and imposing protectionist measures. During the height of the Great Depression, lasting from 1929 to 1932, nearly all of them introduced capital controls and turned their current account deﬁcit into a surplus by raising import tariﬀs, subsidizing exports, and reducing their burden of foreign debt service; Greece also devalued its currency. Only one country, Poland, maintained the gold standard until 1936. In the second half of the 1930s, the last phase, the CESEE countries intensiﬁed their protectionist policies, pursued a more expansionary ﬁscal policy, and experimented with state-led industrialization. As mentioned, the trend towards more interventionist policies between 1918 and 1939 was accompanied by a regime shift. One country after another installed some sort of authoritarian government, not least due to the diﬃcult economic circumstances during the interwar years: Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, and Yugoslavia in the 1920s; Austria, Estonia, Latvia, Greece, and Romania in the 1930s. Only Czechoslovakia remained a democracy throughout the whole period. 1 There was also an intellectual shift. In the beginning of the interwar years, most CESEE countries followed the intellectual tradition linked to the writings of the German economist Friedrich List (1789–1846). His main argument was that backwardness required protection, especially in foreign trade. In the 1930s, they went beyond the Listian approach by opting for the nationalisation of mon- etary policy, capital controls, clearing and trade agreements, and programs of state- led industrialisation.2 They also established a form of corporatism that echoed the model of fascist Italy. Employers and workers were forced to become members of associations and unions that were controlled by the state. Yet, though moving towards comprehensive state intervention, the economic policies of the CESEE countries were still of a fundamentally diﬀerent character than the experiment of the Russian Bolsheviks. After gaining power in the October Revolution of 1917, they embarked on a program of nearly total control of the economy. At the end of the 1920s, they nationalised all sectors of the economy, directed growth according to ﬁve-year plans, and decoupled the economy from the world, whereas all other Eastern European countries continued to allow for market forces, though strongly regulating them. 3 The remainder of the chapter will spell out the common challenges and the diﬀerent policies in more detail. In the ﬁrst two sections, we describe and explain the economic policies adopted by the Eastern European countries in the 1920s and the 1930s. Thereafter, we deal with the Soviet experience. The chapter ends with a short conclusion. Reconstruction and stabilisation (1918–1929) The end of the First World War profoundly reshaped the political and economic map of Central and South-Eastern Europe. First, the Peace Treaties dismembered the Austro-Hungarian Empire and created ﬁve new states in its stead: Poland, 190 Nathan Marcus et al. Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia). Second, the three Baltic republics (Latvia, Estonia, and Lithua- nia) were brought into existence. These new countries joined those already present in the region: Romania (which doubled in size), Bulgaria (which lost territory on all its borders), Albania (which was almost redone from scratch) and Greece (which traded territory and populations with Bulgaria and Turkey). Seeking to obtain a lasting peace, the victors not only forged new nation-states, but also brought to life the League of Nations, a multilateral body charged “to promote international co- operation and to achieve international peace and security.”4 Despite US isolation- ism, the League successfully mediated several territorial disputes during the 1920s but remained helpless as armed conﬂicts increased and member states deserted the organisation in the 1930s. The League considered economic prosperity a condi- tion for peace and became engaged in the economic stabilisation of Eastern Europe right after the War. 5 The First World War had left all the world’s economies in disarray and excep- tional destruction and loss of life across Central and South-Eastern Europe. Food shortages and the Allied blockade had caused starvation and, after the armistice, dying from malnutrition or epidemics continued. Bridges and railway lines lay broken or destroyed, factories had been run without attention to wear or renewal of machinery, and the countryside had been depleted of livestock. Pre-war patterns of trade were disrupted, and industrial and agricultural production kept falling, necessitating the import of food and capital stock. The new nation-states in Central and South-Eastern Europe, aiming for economic independence, had to grapple with transitioning production from wartime to a peace economy and with changes stemming from the reordering of populations and the new national borders that cut across trading and transportation routes. Industrialization and modernization were key, but lacking a solid tax base and the political will and administrative tools for direct taxation, the new governments would seek to borrow abroad to ﬁnance such large expenditures. In dire need of foreign capital to pay for repairs, new machinery, and foreign goods, their ﬁrst aim was to stabilize their economies and new currencies. 6 An early policy commonly adopted across the region, ostensibly to deal with economic challenges, were agricultural reforms. Many rural areas were dominated by large estates, often owned by members of national minorities, which were now conﬁscated, fragmented, and sold to small farmers. Motivated by fears of a Bol- shevik revolution, they were primarily aimed at creating national cohesion and loyalty among peasant citizens of the new states (and thus rarely allocated land to national minorities). 7 Estonia and Latvia, where almost half the land was owned by a small number of Baltic German aristocrats, implemented the most wide-reaching reforms. Greece used them to settle about half a million refugee farmers in its new provinces. Czech and Yugoslav dispossessions also followed ethnic lines but aﬀected only about one-tenth of landed property, and the restructuring of agri- cultural ownership in Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria and Albania remained relatively minor as well.8 A more eﬃcient agricultural sector might have helped provide the Economic policy, 1918–1939 191 economic surplus to pay for vital imports and investments, but overwhelmingly, agricultural reforms, even when they extended the amount of cultivated area, con- tributed little to the mechanization and modernization of farming.9 Generally, the populist reforms tended to diminish agricultural productivity, partly because they questioned future property rights. An international conference, held under League auspices in Brussels in the fall of 1920, charged ﬁnancial experts, oﬃcials, and bankers to develop other ideas to bring about economic recovery. Across Europe, many governments still relied on inﬂation to ﬁnance expenditures. Subsequent currency depreciation made import- ing necessary raw materials, food, and new machinery diﬃcult. Further, while inﬂation reduced much domestic debt, it also destroyed savings and made inter- nal borrowing impossible. The conference pronounced three interlinked policy principles to stabilise currencies, end inﬂation, and beneﬁt international trade and lending: national budgets had to be balanced and ordinary expenditures covered through taxation; inﬂation had to cease so that countries could return to the gold standard; and central banks had to be independent from national governments to uphold ﬁxed exchange rates. The conference also evoked a declaration by the Allied Supreme Council from March that year, calling for the unhindered free ﬂow of goods but with all its expertise devoted to monetary matters, it made no speciﬁc pronouncement on trade.10 More than anywhere else in the world, it was in the capital-poor countries of Central and South-Eastern Europe that the League of Nations put Brussels’ three principles into practice, helping countries issue loans on foreign capital markets in return. In need of foreign capital, Central and South-Eastern European states adopted the three Brussels principles at the Genoa Conference of April 1922, but achiev- ing currency stability proved easier than balancing state budgets (Table 8.1).11 The League of Nations helped stabilise the currencies of many economies in the region, providing technical advice and facilitating the issue of foreign loans.12 Albania welcomed a League of Nations ﬁnancial advisor in 1923, but ended coop- eration after a central bank was founded and public ﬁnances were reformed. 13 Loftier and more enduring economic interventions took place in Austria and Hungary that same year, where large budget deﬁcits had translated into hyperin- ﬂation. The League insisted on balancing the budget and stabilising currencies, helping to ﬂoat foreign loans for both countries in return. At the same time it became active in Greece, too, where following the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne 1.3 million refugees (about 25% of the existing population) needed to be resettled. The League helped Greece obtain a loan in 1924 and issue another in 1928, after the country pledged to balance a reduced budget and charged its reformed central bank to oversee currency stability. Estonia turned to the League in 1924, issuing a foreign loan in 1927 after it, too, had founded a national bank conforming to the Brussels recommendations. The League of Nations further helped issue a loan for Bulgaria in 1927 to assist in resettling its quarter million refugees, and a second in 1928, to strengthen Bulgarian currency stability, help it lower expenditures and balance the national budget.14 192 Nathan Marcus et al. Other countries, some wary of the League’s stringent conditions, managed to issue foreign loans and stabilise their currencies without its help. But they too ascribed primary importance to balanced budgets, independent central banks, and stable exchange rates. In 1922, the Czech government and Prague Municipality both issued a foreign loan with tranches in US dollars and pound sterling, giv- ing Czechoslovakia a stable currency by 1923. Bulgaria successfully used foreign- exchange restrictions to introduce a stable paper currency in 1924, but in both countries budgetary deﬁcits continued throughout the 1920s.15 Yugoslavia achieved currency stability by mid-1925 through foreign exchange interventions, after ﬂoat- ing a US dollar loan in New York in 1922 and French franc loan in Paris in 1924, maintaining budget equilibrium thereafter. Poland founded an independent central bank in 1924, issued an Italian lire loan that year and a US dollar loan the year after, but only achieved currency stabilisation and a balanced budget by autumn 1926. Latvia and Lithuania both established central banks in 1922, introducing new stable currencies after putting their budgets in order and accumulating foreign reserves, though they ran budget deﬁcits towards the end of the decade. Political instability in Romania and Greece postponed stabilization of their currencies to 1927 and 1928, respectively.16 The Greek government, ostensibly keeping a sound budget, engaged in opaque accounting practices that concealed expenditures, but in Romania, Austria, and Hungary, budgets were balanced by the mid-1920s and remained so thereafter. Stable exchange rates encouraged foreign borrowing and cross-border trade and helped economic production, but Czechoslovakia was the only country that managed to attain a net-creditor position through its exports.

Economic policy, 1918–1939 193 The adoption of the Brussels principles in Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, balanced budgets and independent central banks, largely ensured cur- rency exchange-rate stability across the entire region during the second half of the 1920s. 17 Generally, foreign lenders and investors looked for balanced budgets and stable currencies when assessing a country’s creditworthiness. 18 Reassured by suc- cessful currency stabilisations, large sums of foreign capital ﬂowed to the region, largely from the United States and the United Kingdom, but also from France and other European countries. Roughly USD 1.3 billion poured into Eastern European states and enterprises during the 1920s, mainly as ﬁxed-interest loans or short-term credits, but also in the form of investments and acquisitions. The sums necessary to service these foreign debts, both public and private, rose starkly from 1924 to 1929 and negatively impacted countries’ balance of payments, posing diﬃcult challenges for central banks aiming at upholding a currency peg (Table 8.2). 19 Austria and Hungary acquired the heaviest foreign debt burden per capita. The Balkan states borrowed less in absolute terms, but still considerably in relation to the size of their economies, and so their foreign debt service requirements were substantial in light of their limited capacity to earn foreign exchange. 20 Especially Hungary, Poland, and Romania borrowed quite large sums in relation to their economies, too. Thus in 1928, the year foreign borrowing peaked, debt servicing as a percentage of export earnings stood at 17.9% in Hungary, 11.3% in Poland, 14.6% in Romania, and above 30% in Greece.21 For these agricultural exporters, the general decline of crop prices during the second half of the 1920s would prove especially damaging, and Greece in particular faced constant balance-of-payment problems, despite its large remittances from nationals living overseas. 22 The Baltic states, redirecting their trade towards Germany and Britain, achieved manageable TABLE 8.2 Annual foreign debt service requirements in 1924 and 1930 1924 1930 1924–1930 Million USD per capita in percent of exports Million USD per capita in percent of exports per capita rise Austria 5.5 0.70 1.97% 39.9 5.07 15.05% 625.45% Hungary 3.9 0.45 3.33% 35.2 4.05 22.11% 802.56% Czechoslovakia 14.8 1.00 2.94% 19.6 1.33 3.79% 32.43% Poland 12.4 0.38 5.1% 53.9 1.67 19.78% 334.68% Bulgaria 3.6 0.60 10.06% 8.3 1.39 18.62% 130.56% Romania 18.9 1.02 13.62% 32.8 1.77 13.59% 73.54% Yugoslavia* 15.9 1.15 13.02% 23.3 1.76 19.53 65.34% Source: Royall Tyler, The League of Nations Reconstruction Schemes in the Inter-War Period (League of Nations: Geneva, 1945), p. 157.

The situation turned worse after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates and the 1929 crash on Wall Street dried up foreign liquidity. Apart from the Baltic states and Czechoslovakia, all the other countries faced a negative balance of payments and sudden transfer problem as the 1920s came to an end (Table 8.3). 23 Balance-of-payment deﬁcits and expanding money supply at a time when inter- national capital markets were less prone to lend created a toxic concoction. The inevitable outﬂow of foreign currency had to eventually show up in central bank balance sheets, undermining public conﬁdence in currency stability. Earning for- eign currency from exports oﬀered an alternative to foreign borrowing, and foreign trade had expanded across the region in the 1920s, but less than in some Western European countries.24 The potential for growing trade between Bulgaria, Roma- nia, and Yugoslavia seemed favourable in the 1920s as old trade relations persisted and bilateral trade ﬂows between Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary remained high.25 However, in per capita terms, they never reached pre-war levels and the share of agricultural exports declined everywhere.26 Generally, there occurred a redirection of Eastern European trade during the late 1920s towards Western Europe and the rest of the world, but regional trade still remained important.27 Table 8.4 provides insights into these changing relations but gives no information about absolute importance. 28 Among Wilson’s Fourteen Points had been the call for a “removal . . . of all economic barriers and the establishment of equality of trade conditions” all around the world, but instead most new states followed national policies of autarky, aimed at becoming industrially independent. In general, they heavily taxed the import of industrial products to help the development of their own producers. 29 Despite the potential growth of cross-border trade, trade deﬁcits remained quite large, with the exception of Czechoslovakia and perhaps Estonia. The situation was particularly precarious in Hungary and Greece, where in 1928 imports by far outweighed TABLE 8.3 Balance of payments of Central, East and South-East European countries, 1922–1930 CZ HU PL BU RO YU GR EST LAT LIT 1922 −8 +8 1923 +20 +3 1924 −14 −43 −2 −22 +19 −6 +9 1925 +15 −26 −126 −7 −49 −6 +1 1926 +57 −13 +91 −7 −46 −8 −5 +3 1927 +58 −26 −82 −4 −113 −23 +2 +4 +1 1928 +56 −89 −124 −7 −27 −2 +1 −1 1929 +22 −91 −68 −21 +13 −45 −2 −5 +5 1930 +42 −38 −3 −1 −35 −34 −2 +1 Source: International capital movements during the inter-war period (United Nations, Dept. of Eco- nomic Aﬀairs: Lake Success, NY, 1949), pp. 11–2.

Romania, a wheat exporter, similarly increased import duties most considerably in 1924 and 1927 to beneﬁt its agricultural sector and nascent industries. Poland, which sub- sidised its coal and agrarian exporters, increased customs tariﬀs in 1924 and 1928, and Yugoslavia, which predominately exported cereals, fostered domestic pro- duction through waiving import duties on coal and certain industrial equipment. Greece protected its wheat growers and nascent industries like soap manufacturing TABLE 8.4 Change of reported imports from 1926 to 1929 IMPORTING FROM AU AL BU CZ GR HU PL RO YU EST LAT LIT GER ITIMPORTING COUNTRY AU   315 −40 −14     17 20 −1   −64   49 −25 AL 100   −34 −66       181         9 BU −11   30 −22 12 42 38 80       28 −14 CZ 53   −14 4850 −14 5 28 −29   100 248   100 GR   −27 −29 38 112   18 98       25   HU     36 7 633 20 38 86         103 PL −29   1017 58   −48 −27 −5   83   6 −24 RO −3   0 67 78 44 −38 −13       62 −51 YU −6 0 −55 −12 133 −22 137 −41       46 −1601 EST                       29   LAT 34     30     224       −11 29   LIT       41             −19 7 191 GER 69   42   59 7 −21 322 −27 3 79 62   IT −4 −11 −14 −24     185 −46 7     −99   Source: Katherine Barbieri and Omar Keshk. 2012.

On the other hand, Czechoslovakia, an exporter of manufac- tured goods, exempted the import of machinery from customs duties in 1925 and though new customs moderately protected agrarians, its tariﬀs were not gen- erally raised after 1922. Hungary, which had built up a manufacturing industry and launched new import substituting enterprises in chemicals, paper, and textiles, mainly exported wheat, ﬂower, sugar, and meat. Due to the League’s intervention program, both Hungary and Austria, the latter an exporter of manufactured goods, had abandoned all trade restrictions and their tariﬀs did not provide any preferential support for industries. 33 Apart from protectionist customs, states relied on tax policy to support eco- nomic development, and because direct taxation in most states was politically not practical, balanced budgets relied heavily on tariﬀs and other indirect taxation. Levels of taxation were relatively high for the time and in many states designed to create and support industrial production, which hurt foreign trade.34 More speciﬁ- cally, Bulgaria granted tax beneﬁts to domestic ﬁrms and industries, further oﬀer- ing them reduced transport charges and preferential treatment in public contracts. Hungary similarly granted tax exemptions to facilitate domestic construction and the establishment of new factories, while oﬀering cheaper railway rates to local producers. Czechoslovakia applied tax breaks for enterprises deemed nationally important or purchasing new industrial equipment, while Romania granted low rail charges and certain tax exemptions to non-Jewish Romanians and enterprises using domestic produce. In the Baltic states, all three governments adopted policies to promote agricultural production. In Yugoslavia, the state itself founded several industrial enterprises, providing help to others in form of subsidies, grants, tax exemptions, or freight reductions. 35 Geared towards autarky and fostering home production, high tariﬀs and pro- tectionist taxation harmed national economies by reducing the proﬁtability of cross-country trade. An obvious remedy to the countries’ balance-of-payment deﬁcits would have been the expansion of exports, but League assistance addressed only budgets and currencies and its talks to facilitate economic collaboration were unsuccessful. After discussing their economic situation at a conference in Porto- Rosa (today Portorož) in 1921, Central European states failed to ratify a trade agreement. 36 The League’s Council repeatedly called for normalizing international trade and commissioned several studies stressing the danger of autarkic policies in the Danubian region, but without eﬀect.37 The League’s ultimate push for an international agreement to abolish trade restrictions and non-tariﬀ barriers during the Geneva Economic Conference of 1927 faltered because not enough states rati- ﬁed the agreement. In the words of Otto Niemeyer, the inﬂuential British member of the League’s Financial Committee, failure to enforce free cross-border trade was the “Achilles’ heel” of League interventions in the region and the League repre- sentative to Hungary would later term it as “perhaps the most powerful, of the reasons that caused the breakdown of the 1919–1920 Settlement in Central and South-Eastern Europe.” 38 Economic policy, 1918–1939 197 TABLE 8.5 Trade deﬁcit in percent of exports, 1919–1929 AL AU BU CZ GR HU PL RO YU EST LAT LIT 1919 −650 −93 −75 −6 −99 6   −33       25 1920 −1066 29 −35 15 −221 −154 −25 −102 −162 −14 −92 −31 1921 −813 −88 −6 20 −82 −105 −28 −93 −68 −98 −139 −65 1922 −305 −52 31 31 −24 −63 −29 12 −75 −16 −7 1 1923 −188 −71 −19 22 −137 −23 7 21 −1 −63 −16 −1439 1924 −67 −83 3 7 −146 −22 −17 7 14 −4 −51 23 1925 −27 −55 −17 6 −128 −5 −26 −4 2 0 −56 −4 1926 −109 −62 −11 14 −84 −9 31 3 2 1 −53 5 1927 −113 −51 8 11 −109 −43 −15 11 −14 9 −13 −8 1928 −160 −47 −13 9 −98 −45 −34 −17 −22 −3 −18 −13 1929 −170 −49 −30 2 −90 3 −11 −2 4 −5 −40 7 Source: Katherine Barbieri and Omar Keshk. 2012.

The hurdles economic nationalism posed through protectionist taxation and high tariﬀs were serious and prevented cross-border trade from reaching pre-war levels in the 1920s. 39 But trade did not stop and economic performance through- out the region improved during the second half of the decade.40 The largely agri- cultural economies were geared towards exporting primary products to pay for the import of machinery and capital goods, but tax subsidies and tariﬀ protection exacerbated their lack of competitiveness. The more industrialised nations fought to ﬁnd new foreign markets for their semi-ﬁnished and ﬁnished products in order to buy raw materials and pay for the importation of food and consumer goods. All countries needed to stimulate exports to earn the foreign exchange necessary for servicing foreign debt, but most state-driven infrastructure projects to modernize national railways, ports or invest in hydro-electricity showed little eﬀect. Infra- structural development was costly and piecemeal, and while the share of industrial employment rose consistently across the region, it did so only slowly, and mainly in the cities. 41 While the Baltic states had a largely stable balance of payments, the other coun- tries of Central Europe, with the exception of Czechoslovakia, steered towards a potential transfer problem. Widespread trade deﬁcits certainly spelled the potential for crisis and pointed to its possible remedy (Table 8.5). But despite the guiding hand of the League of Nations, the already sluggish pace of trade liberalisation was bogged down by national jealousies. As one historian put it, national “politicians’ inability to take a broad view of the economic situation . . . their failure to under- stand the crucial importance of multinational initiatives” doomed the interwar set- tlement in Eastern Europe. 42 Thus on the eve of the Great Depression the outlook was not entirely bleak, but Europe’s periphery remained economically weak, and 198 Nathan Marcus et al. ﬁnancially dependent on the West. As long as its countries ascribed to the gold- standard orthodoxies prescribed by the Brussels conference and preached by the League of Nations, they could not prosper without a continued recourse to foreign loans or a better access to (regional) export markets. Depression and recovery (1929–1939) The Great Depression profoundly altered the conditions under which CESEE countries had to conduct economic policies. Some have argued that 1931 marks “the deﬁnite turn to state intervention” (Ránki and Tomaszewski 1986, p. 22). Yet economic policies in CESEE were driven by necessity rather than choice. Foreign indebtedness limited monetary policy options and the loss of foreign reserves left the introduction of exchange controls as the only viable option for most CESEE countries if they were to keep honouring their foreign debt. Continuous scarcity of foreign exchange restricted international trade to operate mainly on a clearing basis. Fiscal policy space was limited and further diminished by the weak state of agriculture and industry that required government subsidies. Increased govern- ment intervention in CESEE – taking control of foreign exchange, strong regula- tion of international trade including import substitution policies, price controls, and cartelization – leads to a conclusion that economic policy of CESEE mainly diﬀered from that of Western Europe during the 1930s. Still governments across CESEE inﬂuenced economic activity within a market economy and remained relatively open to the international economy. This contrasted with the policies of nationalization and autarky pursued by the Soviet Union. Table 8.6 charts the depression and recovery in CESEE and rest of Europe dur- ing the interwar based on GDP per capita estimates. Column 1 reports the pre- depression peak year and column 2 the trough year. The Great Depression arrived in most Central, East and South-East European (CESEE) countries in 1929. The duration of economic downturn varied. The downturn lasted from two years in Greece to six years in Czechoslovakia. Column 3 reports the amplitude (i.e. the peak to trough decline) of GDP per capita. From 1929 to 1933, Poland lost a quar- ter of its income per capita. Greece was on the other extreme, experiencing a fall of almost 9 per cent. Peak to trough GDP per capita fell on average by almost 17 per cent in CESEE (almost 16 per cent if we count the ﬁrst instead of the second dip of the depression in Bulgaria). The amplitude in the rest of Europe (ROE) – Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK – was on average around 10 per cent. In this respect, CESEE was particularly hard hit by the Great Depression in comparison to the rest of Europe. As we discuss further later, one reason for this was high foreign indebtedness that constrained policy options in CESEE and in so doing prolonged the downturn. The last two columns depict the heterogeneous recovery process in CESEE. Greece recovered the fastest, surpassing its pre-depression peak already in 1933. On the contrary, several countries did not reach full recovery by the end Economic policy, 1918–1939 199 TABLE 8.6 Depression and recovery according to GDP per capita developments, CESEE and rest of Europe during the interwar period Peak year 1 Trough year Amplitude (%) 2 Recovery year 3 GDP pc 1938/ peak year 4 Germany 1929 1932 −24.62 1936 1.20 France 1929 1932 −16.12 n.a. 0.94 UK 1929 1932 −6.19 1934 1.13 Poland 1929 1933 −24.87 1938 1.03 Austria 1929 1933 −23.53 n.a. 0.85 Czechoslovakia 1929 1935 −21.12 n.a. 0.94 Yugoslavia 1929 1932 −17.08 n.a. 0.99 Bulgaria 1927 1929 −6.01 1930 1.27 1931 1935 −14.93 1936 1.10 Romania 1927 1930 −13.38 1934 0.98 Hungary 1929 1932 −11.43 1936 1.08 Greece 1929 1931 −8.92 1933 1.14 CESEE avg. −16.91 ROE 5 avg. −10.39 Source: Broadberry and Klein (2012) Notes: 1Interwar data on Greece and Poland starts from 1929. 2 Peak to trough decline of GDP per capita in per cent. 3 Interwar year in which previous peak was reached again; n.a. – if outside interwar. 4 Inter- war data on Austria and Czechoslovakia end in 1937. 5 ROE – rest of Europe comprising 12 Western European countries given in Maddison (2003) excluding Austria. of the interwar. Austria recovered the least. By 1937 Austria was still 15 per cent below its pre-depression peak. Economic policy played a central role in the process of depression and recovery in Europe in the 1930s. The standard account stresses the abandoning of the gold standard as the crucial step in economic policy that contributed to the end of the Great Depression (Feinstein et al. 2008, p. 93). Countries that left the gold standard had their monetary and ﬁscal policies freed from “golden fetters” (Eichengreen 1992). Countries with depreciated currencies (e.g. the UK) enjoyed faster eco- nomic recovery than countries that remained on gold (e.g. France) (Eichengreen and Sachs 1985). Leaving the gold standard was an economic policy forced by economic forces  – reserve losses, banking crises, main trading partner currency devaluation, unemployment, and deﬂationary pressure (Wolf 2008, pp. 398–399; Straumann 2009, p.  616), as well as political instability (Wandschneider 2008, pp.  175–176). The eﬀects of ﬁscal policy on recovery were minor due to the limited use of deﬁcit spending (Almunia et al. 2010, pp. 234–235; Feinstein et al. 2008, p. 131). Protectionism led to “beggar-thy-neighbour” policies that impeded foreign trade and harmed economic recovery (Eichengreen and Sachs 1985; Irwin 2011). How do economic policies pursued by CESEE countries ﬁt into this 200 Nathan Marcus et al. conventional view on depression and recovery in the 1930? How and why did economic policy of CESEE countries diﬀer from Western Europe? Table  8.7 documents the dates of policy measures aﬀecting exchange rate regimes in 11 CESEE countries during the 1930s. It reports when countries imposed exchange control, depreciated or devalued their currency in relation to gold parity, and oﬃcially left the gold standard. Over the course of the 1930s, 11 CESEE countries resorted to exchange control. Nine countries  – Hungary, Greece, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Latvia, Austria, Bulgaria, Estonia, and Roma- nia (in that order) – did so by the end of 1931. Greece followed the sterling bloc and devalued its currency early. Poland followed the gold bloc and stayed on gold until 1936. What explains these diﬀerent policy choices? Foreign indebtedness forced many CESEE countries to impose exchange con- trols without formally abandoning gold. For all CESEE countries except Czecho- slovakia, currency devaluation was not readily available given the high levels of foreign denominated sovereign debt. While devaluation may have improved inter- national competitiveness, it would have necessitated a larger amount of domestic currency to acquire foreign exchange in order to service foreign debt. Having a large share of debt denominated in French francs and/or debt with gold clauses only worsened the debtor’s position. Unlike the pound or the dollar, the franc did not devalue in the ﬁrst half of the 1930s. And having the gold clause meant debt was to be repaid in gold or its equivalent even if the currency in which the debt was denominated was devalued.

This proved increasingly hard in the second half of 1931 due to losses of central bank reserves (Nikolić 2017). Exchange controls were an eﬀort to defend ﬁxed exchange rates and stop the drain on reserves (Ellis 1941, pp. 878–879). Exchange controls were, however, insuﬃcient to stop capital outﬂows from Greece. Only seven months after introducing exchange controls, Greece devalued its currency and oﬃcially left the gold standard. Despite suﬀering severe losses of central bank reserves and a banking crisis, Poland was able to stay on the gold standard given its large cover ratio (Nikolić 2017). Poland’s “strategic partnership” with France also played a role (Wolf 2007, 2008). How did the diﬀerent monetary policy choices aﬀect the recovery from the depression of CESEE countries? All else equal, for two countries at the extreme the relation seems clear – Greece devalued early and recovered faster than Poland, which remained on gold until 1936. For other countries that imposed exchange controls the picture looks more complicated. As Table 8.7 shows, some of these countries indeed oﬃcially devalued their currencies at certain points of the 1930s. Moreover, all of them relied on a so-called premium system to make their exports more competitive internationally.43 Indeed, currency depreciation in the 1930s took many forms (Eichengreen and Sachs 1985, p. 931). Nevertheless, judging by the belated or incomplete recovery of the exchange control group, this practice seems to have been sub-optimal to oﬃcial devaluation. The imposition of exchange controls across CESEE during the 1930s had seri- ous implications on the way these countries conducted international trade. The introduction of exchange controls involved concentrating all foreign exchange transactions at the central bank (Ellis 1941). With each transaction involving for- eign currencies being supervised by the state, governments were eﬀectively put in charge of international trade. Faced with the problem of foreign exchange scarcity, CESEE countries increasingly relied on trade through clearing – a system of inter- national trade that reduced the need for foreign currency. Clearing arrangements allowed for a more or less reciprocal exchange of goods between countries with foreign exchange being required only at the end of the year when outstanding bal- ances were being cleared (Ránki and Tomaszewski 1986, pp. 27–29). In Bulgaria, Hungary, and Yugoslavia, as much as 70 per cent of entire trade was conducted on a clearing basis already by 1932–1933, while Poland and Czechoslovakia resorted less to this practice during the 1930s (Drabek 1985, pp. 451–452). Regulation of trade opened the way for protectionist trade policy that went far beyond the measures of the 1920s (Ránki and Tomaszewski 1986, p. 29). CESEE countries made use of their control over international trade by reducing the share of consumer goods and ﬁnal manufactures in imports (Drabek 1985, pp. 460–465). Reduced imports of ﬁnished goods opened a larger share of the home market to domestic producers. Thus import substitution policies were directed at limiting the outﬂow of foreign exchange and improving the balance of trade but at the same 202 Nathan Marcus et al. time also to protecting domestic industries. In this way, exchange rate, trade, and industrial policy were closely related. While using protectionist economic policy during the 1930s, the CESEE coun- tries did not turn to autarky. Table 8.8 shows the developments of the openness ratio  – exports plus imports as share of GDP  – for eight CESEE countries for 1929, 1933, and 1937. During the depression trade fell more vigorously than pro- duction (Kindleberger 1986; Feinstein et  al. 2008, 93–97) and accordingly the openness ratio of CESEE countries declined. From 1933 to 1937, the openness ratio increased. This shows that trade played an increasing role towards the end of the interwar. In South-East Europe, vast improvements in transport infrastructure promoted trade and outweighed the negative eﬀects of protectionism (Morys and Ivanov 2015, p. 497). Still, with the exception of Romania, CESEE openness ratios did not recover to their 1929 levels. How large was ﬁscal policy space in CESEE during the 1930s? Production and trade were greatly reduced during the Great Depression (Feinstein et  al. 2008, pp. 93–97). This led to a drop in government revenues across Europe. Faced with budget deﬁcits, CESEE governments were reluctant to cut spending (Spigler 1986, p.  128). Insofar as continued spending could not be met by increased taxation, closing budget deﬁcits entailed borrowing domestically or abroad. The collapse of international long-term lending came in 1931 (Accominotti and Eichengreen 2015). With the ﬁnancial crisis of 1931 depleting already low domestic savings, instead of issuing bonds on the domestic capital markets, for the most part CESEE governments turned to the treasury for funds to ﬁnance pressing needs. For South- East European countries faced with continuous budget deﬁcits, debt monetisation became the norm (Morys 2015, p. 24). Most CESEE countries defaulted on their foreign debt in the course of the 1930s. Decrease of exports and foreign exchange earnings, increased government subsidies, and a wanting reduction in the sizeable share of government expenditures TABLE 8.8 Exports plus imports as share of GDP (openness ratio), CESEE 1929–1937 1929 1933 1937 1 Austria 45.1 21.3 27.2 Bulgaria 26.2 14.2 21.5 Czechoslovakia 43.3 16.3 27.1 Greece 62.5 35.4 43.8 Hungary 32.7 15.6 20.0 Poland 22.8 13.0 15.5 Romania 21.8 15.0 22.0 Yugoslavia 25.9 17.3 25.6 Sources: GDP data for Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland from (Lethbridge 1985, p. 550), Eckstein (1955 p. 165), and (Lethbridge 1985, p. 571) respectively. Trade data are from Mitchell (2013). Open- ness ratio of other countries from (Morys and Ivanov 2015, p. 397). Note: 1 Openness ratio for Poland refers to 1936. Economic policy, 1918–1939 203 committed to foreign debt service made it increasingly diﬃcult for CESEE coun- tries to service their foreign debt. The concentration of foreign exchange transac- tions at the central bank as part of exchange control policy meant that countries that introduced exchange controls eﬀectively prohibited foreign payments and made the government the mediator between domestic debtors and foreign credi- tors. In many cases, however, even taking control over foreign exchange proved insuﬃcient in gathering enough foreign currency to keep servicing foreign debt. According to the League of Nations (League of Nations 1936, pp. 298–303) and subsequent research (Ellis 1939, pp.  53, 91; Gnjatović 1991, p.  172; Dimitrova and Ivanov 2014, p. 221; Hinić et al. 2014, p. 298; Lazaretou 2014, pp. 102, 123, 131; Stoenescu et al. 2014, pp. 247, 273), the following CESEE countries partially or fully defaulted on their foreign debt: Hungary in December  1931, Bulgaria in April  1932, Greece in May  1932, Austria in July  1932, Yugoslavia in Octo- ber 1932, and Romania in August 1933. The reduction in the foreign debt burden and increased budget revenues opened more ﬁscal policy space. The reduction in foreign debt was a result of defaults, debt conversions, and the devaluation of the dollar (Spigler 1986, p. 146; Nötel 1986, pp.  261–264). Increasing budget revenues came along with economic recovery. Increased ﬁscal policy space was used for public works and defence programmes (Ránki and Tomaszewski 1986, pp. 40–48). CESEE governments were able to fund productive infrastructure projects such as building new roads and railways but also to engage in “frantic rearmament” (Hauner 1986, p. 49) needed to defend their newly established independence. By the end of the interwar CESEE countries had developed a much improved infrastructure that was nevertheless still far behind that of Western Europe (Ehrlich 1985, p. 369). No doubt both light (e.g. food and tex- tiles) and heavy industries (e.g. metals and machinery) beneﬁted from the demand produced by government spending. But it is unclear to what extent this translated into economic growth. Poor economic conditions, aggravated by the Great Depression, contributed to the rise of economic nationalism. While starting the interwar period as democ- racies, most European countries and all CESEE countries succumbed to some form of authoritarian rule by the end of the interwar (Aldcroft 2006, pp. 15–16). Authoritarian rule made it easier to conduct nationalist economic policies. Eco- nomic nationalism in CESEE included exchange controls, protectionism, import substitution, and state promotion of agriculture and industry (Batou and David 1998, pp. xviii–xix). These policies aimed to open up space for political manoeuvre and reduce relative economic backwardness, and were a consequence of the Great Depression and overall external conditions rather than based on a preconceived and clearly deﬁned ideology (Kofman 1990, pp. 49–54). Economic nationalism gained increasing momentum in the 1930s (Aldcroft 1998, p. 131), but was not exclusive to this period. Nostriﬁcation policies – trans- fer of real and ﬁnancial assets from foreign to domestic owners under the legislative process (Teichova 1985, p. 6) – were pursued already in the aftermath of the First World War and the 1920s. Agricultural reforms, discussed in the previous section, 204 Nathan Marcus et al. are one example. The purchase of shares in enterprises and banks from their foreign owners is another. Nostriﬁcation was also conducted without necessarily changing the ownership structure, by substituting the “domestic” (ethnic majority) work- force for “alien” nationals (ethnic minorities) on all levels  – from the board of directors to unskilled workers (Boyer 2000, p. 272; Koll 2000, p. 367). The increasing role of the state in CESEE during the interwar did not, how- ever, lead to the emergence of Western-type welfare states. During the 1930s the share of CESEE budget expenditure captured by government spending on public health and social welfare as well as education remained more or less constant (Spi- gler 1986, pp. 167–169). It is therefore hard to argue that CESEE participated in the acceleration of social spending recorded in developed economies during the interwar (Lindert 2004). Nevertheless, CESEE governments did implement a set of welfare policies intended to alleviate the negative eﬀects that the fall in prices of agricultural produce had on these predominantly agrarian economies. For exam- ple, governments set up institutions that would purchase goods from agricultural producers above market prices. Further, laws were introduced that allowed peasant debt to be rescheduled, partially or completely written oﬀ, or even taken on by the state. Finally, governments supported the creation of cartels across several industries (especially in food processing) with the aim of stabilising prices at a higher level (Ránki and Tomaszewski 1986, pp. 22–25, 30–31). Russia and the Soviet Union (1917–39) Though most CESEE countries moved towards authoritarianism and state-inter- ventionism, it would be wrong to liken them to the Bolshevik experiment launched in the aftermath of the October Revolution of 1917. 44 Convinced that backward Russia needed to overcome the capitalist system in order to become a rich and powerful nation, the revolutionaries brought the economy under nearly total con- trol of the government. As Ellman (2014) points out, socialist planning “originated in a backward country, and its major purpose was to propel the countries which adopted it into the ranks of the advanced countries.” 45 The most inﬂuential thinker who used Marxism to develop a new theory was Vladimir Lenin (1870–1924), the leader of the Bolsheviks. He was convinced that Russia needed full nationalisation and a dictatorship in order to catch up. 46 The Bolshevik leadership did not have a blueprint when they started their experiment, however. As Lenin explained in April 1918: “We know about socialism, but knowledge of organisation on a scale of millions, knowledge of the organisation and distribution of goods, etc., – this we do not have.” 47 First steps towards government control of the economy were taken shortly after the October Revolution. According to Harrison (2016), three crucial elements of the command system were established: the principle of unconditional conﬁsca- tion of private property, the control of industrial supply, and the control of food produce that was judged to be surplus to the farmers’ own basic consumption. As became the rule, economic policies were always closely linked to political goals. Economic policy, 1918–1939 205 The conﬁscation of private property weakened the enemies of the revolution and helped secure the support of important segments of the population, especially in the countryside. Further measures in the early stage of the Soviet experiment were the nationalisation of industry and banking, the establishment of state monopolies over domestic trade in foodstuﬀs and foreign trade, and the takeover of manage- ment of large manufacturers and transport. Finally, in order to avoid a revolt by workers and soldiers, the Bolshevists took over the distribution of food by using violence against farmers and traders. 48 The command economy was further strengthened by measures taken during the civil war that escalated in early 1919 and lasted until late 1922. The government nationalised the whole industrial sector down to the smallest units and monopo- lised all domestic trade. Government control of industry was enlarged to producers of intermediate goods, and farmers were forced to cede food that was not needed for subsistence. The command economy was not fully realised yet, but at this point Bolshevik economic policies had gone far beyond any historical experience. Even Germany’s economic policies during the war were much less intrusive. The nation- alisation and control of a large part of the economy and the use of violence were unprecedented and formed an important basis for the shift to a command system that, beginning with the launch of the ﬁrst Five-Year Plan in October 1928, con- sisted of the ﬁve elements: nearly complete nationalisation of all economic sectors, collectivisation of agriculture, central planning, rapid industrialisation by the means of ﬁve-year plans, and decoupling from the world economy. The road to the ﬁrst Five-Year Plan was not predetermined, however. The ﬁrst attempt to form a command economy and the civil war of 1919–1920 precipitated famine and a monetary and economic collapse, leading the Bolshevik leadership to change course and to opt for the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1921. The NEP allowed for market mechanisms under the umbrella of socialism and consisted of a peculiar mixture of private and public elements. The land remained national- ised (since November 1917), but agriculture was controlled by the peasants. Fuel, heavy industry, railways, foreign trade, and the ﬁnancial system – the “command- ing heights” of the Russian economy – were still in the hands of the Bolshevik government; the rest, in particular agriculture, crafts and domestic trade, were left to private ﬁrms. Most importantly, state control was replaced by market transac- tions across and between the economic sectors. In addition, the NEP encouraged foreign trade and stabilised the currency. 49 The new regime achieved its ultimate goal, namely to reinvigorate the econ- omy. By 1928 real national income had climbed back to the level of 1913 – corre- sponding to an increase by more than 150 percent relative to 1921.50 Nevertheless, Stalin ended the experiment in 1928. Gregory and Stuart (2001) cite four reasons. 51 First, the NEP had always been considered a temporary regime, as the private and market elements contradicted the core of Marxist-Leninist theory. Second, the NEP strengthened private traders (nepmen) and prosperous farmers (kulaks) who were seen as threats to economic and political stability. Third, the Bolshevik leader- ship feared that the NEP had reached its potential and was based on an outmoded 206 Nathan Marcus et al. capital stock. New capital accumulation was needed. And ﬁnally, the NEP was seen as a straitjacket for a coordinated industrialisation eﬀort. In sum, ideological motives as well as political and security considerations were at the forefront of the decision. 52 Originally, the Bolshevist leadership was divided on the question of whether or not to end the NEP. Roughly speaking, there were two sides in the debate that started after Lenin’s death in 1924. The left side, led by Leon Trotsky, advocated an ambitious industrialisation strategy and the expropriation of prosperous peasants (kulaks). The other side favoured a continuation of the NEP and a rapprochement with the capitalist world. Its most important proponent was Nikolai Bukharin, the editor of the party paper Pravda. Joseph Stalin, general secretary of the Communist Party since 1922, ﬁrst sided with the moderate view and expelled leftist propo- nents, most notably Trotsky, but then shifted his position and removed the group of Bukharin and his followers. By manoeuvring from one side to the other, Sta- lin succeeded in consolidating his power, while changing his ideological outlook. Politics and policy were closely intertwined. Stalin did not simply adopt a well-formulated plan, but went beyond the ideas developed in the mid-1920s. 53 The ﬁrst Five-Year Plan launched in October 1928 deﬁned output targets for each year, both for economic sectors and individual ﬁrms. Proﬁts, prices, and interest rates were secondary, and ﬁrms were not con- strained by bank credit. The bulk of investment went into heavy industry and machinery production, thus creating a supply that was not dictated by consump- tion, but by the goal to accumulate capital in order to meet future needs, including for military use. And once the plan started, the Soviet authorities always increased the targets in order to accelerate production. In the course of the ﬁrst Five-Year Plan, Stalin proceeded to the collectivisa- tion of the agricultural sector. Sanctioned by the decision of the Central Com- mittee of the KPSU in November of 1929, the government forced all peasants to cede their land to collective farms (kolkhoz). By the end of the 1930s more than 90 per cent of the peasant households were collectivised.54 The immediate reason for this decision was a shortage of grain that Stalin falsely blamed on the kulaks. The collectivisation together with forced savings allowed the government to use the agricultural surplus to sell it to foreign markets, thereby obtaining the means to ﬁnance industrialisation. The tight control of the peasantry also made it easier to bring part of the ineﬃcient employee population in the countryside move to the industrial cities. The second and third Five-Year Plans, launched in 1933 and 1938, respectively, continued the path opened by nationalisation and collectivisation. How successful was Stalin’s industrialisation strategy? First and foremost, there is no doubt that the human toll was enormous. According to Livi-Bacci (1993), the collectivisation famine in 1932–33 cost between 6 and 13 million lives, pre- dominantly in the Ukraine. The purges of the 1930s led to nearly a million killed citizens. Millions were deported to the gulag. The industrialisation strat- egy required a political system that was totalitarian and in many ways inhumane. Economic policy, 1918–1939 207 Economic and political control were two sides of the same coin.55 As for the suc- cess in economic terms, there are two diﬀerent camps. According to Allen (2003), “big push industrialisation” was the only realistic option that was available to Russia at the time.56 A more gradual approach would not have removed the tradi- tional bottlenecks – the low productivity of handicraft production and small-scale agriculture – that had hampered industrialisation. Allen also claims that between 1928 and 1940 Soviet GDP increased by 85 percent, the urban standard of living improved, and income per head of peasant household were not lower at the end of the 1930s than in 1928 (i.e. before collectivisation started). And thanks to mass schooling, human capital was upgraded. For these reasons, Allen considers Stalin’s forced industrialisation successful. This view has been challenged by a number of scholars. Ellman (2004) questions the idea that politics and economics can be separated when it comes to measuring living standards in the 1930s. Some urban dwellers may have had a higher living standard in 1937 than in 1928, but 1937–1938 were also the years of mass state terror. About a million people died, more than a million people were sent to the gulag, bringing misery to their families, and about 200,000 people were deported. Ellman is also sceptical about Allen’s estimates demonstrating that rural per capita consumption in 1938–1939 was not lower than in 1928, although the collectivisa- tion had brought famine and hardship. Applying a two-sector neoclassical growth model to Russian economic history, Cheremukhin et al. (2017) reject Allen’s claim that Tsarist agricultural institutions were a signiﬁcant barrier to labour reallocation to manufacturing, or that “big push” mechanisms were a major driver of Soviet growth. Thus, the jury on the potential economic merits of socialist industrializa- tion strategies is still out. Conclusion The interwar years saw important economic policy changes in Eastern Europe. The most radical shift occurred in Russia after the October Revolution of 1917. Following a brutal civil war and the interlude of the NEP, the Bolshevists under the leadership of Joseph Stalin almost entirely nationalised the economy, pushed industrialisation on the basis of ﬁve-year plans, and decoupled the coun- try from the world market, resulting in a human toll unheard of. The changes in the other Eastern European countries were less radical than in the Soviet Union but also profound. Whereas the pre-war era was dominated by liberal economic policies, the interwar years witnessed growing state intervention- ism and economic nationalism. In the 1920s, governments experimented with tariﬀs and tax subsidies in order to protect domestic sectors and foster exports. In the 1930s they introduced capital and exchange controls, devalued their currencies, reneged on their foreign debt, regulated foreign trade, and initiated industrial policies. Measured against the diﬃcult starting point after the First World War, the economic policies of the CESEE countries were successful. At the end of the 1930s, GDP per capita levels were everywhere higher than in 208 Nathan Marcus et al. 1918. On the other hand, circumstances proved too challenging to allow these countries to escape from their peripheral status. The divide between East and West persisted throughout the period.

Clavin (2013). 6 Many of the new political borders seem to have followed older economic fractures, ethnic or linguistic, so that their adverse eﬀect on trade might have been no larger than that of the previously existing barriers.

The Yugoslav central bank, established in 1920 was under government control and British demands to grant it independence in 1928 were refused. The prewar Romanian National Bank remained under heavy government inﬂuence, but the Polish central bank established in 1924 remained independent until the Great Depression, as did the Czech National Bank founded in 1925. The Austrian and Hungarian central banks, established as parts of the League intervention, were independent from government, and the Bul- garian National Bank gained full autonomy in 1927 in preparation of its League Stabili- sation loan of 1928. Also in 1928, Estonia established a new central bank and currency and the Bank of Greece began its function. Spigler (1986, pp. 146–148).

The Greek state debt service was well matched by capital inﬂows, but left the large trade deﬁcit uncovered. Aldcroft (2006, p. 55). Lampe and Jackson (1982, pp. 386, 428, 512).

Between 1928 and 1929 new issues for account of the six Economic policy, 1918–1939 209 largest borrowers (Germany, Japan, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia) fell from $570 to just $52 million.

As pointed out by Radice (1985, p. 35), it would be wrong to view the Austro-Hungarian customs area before 1914 as a uniﬁed, economic space, but besides the Baltics, Bulgaria, and Albania, all countries were grappling with trade problems arising from its breakup. 25 In 1925, the Danubian states (Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Yugo- slavia) were importing less from outside the conﬁnes of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire than before 1914. The Baltic States had directed their exports to Germany and Great Britain, and by 1927 over 60 per cent of Estonian and Latvian exports went to these two countries. For Lithuania this ﬁgure was above 75 per cent. Aldcroft (2006, p.  105). Tyler (1945, pp.  94, 140–141, 150–155). Ménil and Maurel (1994, p.  564).

The corresponding import ﬁgures were +27 per cent for Bulgaria, +124 per cent for Greece, +104 per cent for Yugoslavia and −13 per cent for Romania. However, these ﬁgures do not take account of impor- tant territorial adjustments. Yugoslav ﬁgures are matched with those of pre-war Serbia, Greater Romania’s with those of the Old Kingdom. In the case of Bulgaria, which lost territory, these ﬁgures are more informative. Lampe and Jackson (1982, p. 343). Trade relations beyond the region improved, too: e.g. Austrian exports to Germany rose by 62 per cent, to France 187 per cent, to Britain 35 per cent, to Russia 594 per cent and to the United States by more than 300 per cent. Nautz (1992, pp. 539–359). 29 Walters (1988, p. 154). 30 Only Albania was in a worse position than Greece. The Greek trade deﬁcit could not be covered by remittances from émigrés or invisible exports. After its new central bank began operation in late 1928, Greek foreign reserves diminished by 25 per cent in 1929, a trend made worse by capital ﬂight the following year. Hungary, a typical agrarian producer, faced diﬃculties servicing its $700 million foreign obligations when the fall in prices of primary products reduced exports. Poland, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria feared similarly. Tyler (1945, p. 94). Feinstein et al. (2008, p. 36). 31 The pre-war overall average, excluding the Austro-Hungarian Empire, had been 28 per cent.

Hungary was governed by irredentism, which led it to embark on a policy of autarky. The Little Entente – Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia – while threatened by Hungarian revisionism, were equally opposed to a return of Austrian hegemony.

In 1920, about 75 per cent of the Polish popula- tion was engaged in agriculture (i.e. peasants), but 20 years later that ﬁgure had dropped to 60 per cent. See Walters (1988, p. 181). 42 Walters (1988, p. 152). 43 A premium was paid above the oﬃcial exchange rate when converting hard foreign currency into domestic currency. In this way CESEE exports were made cheaper to importers paying in foreign currency without oﬃcially changing the exchange rate. On the other hand, imports were made more expensive as more domestic currency was needed to acquire foreign exchange required for imports (Ránki and Tomaszewski 1986, p. 28). 44 For an overview of the period, see Nove (1982), Hunter and Szyrmer (1992), Davies, Harrison and Wheatcroft (1994), Gregory and Stuart (2001), Ellman (2014) and Har- rison (2016). 45 Ellman (2014, p. 4). 46 On the ideas underlying the Bolshevist experiment, see e.g. Barnett (2004). 47 Session of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of 29 April 1918, cited in Ell- man (2014, p. 2). 48 Harrison (2016, pp. 9–11). 49 Johnson and Temin (1993). 50 Markevich and Harrison (2011, p. 680), table 5. 51 Gregory and Stuart (2001, pp. 47–48). 52 The close relationship between economic policies and power and security considera- tions is highlighted by several recent studies that are based on archival research.

This chapter will discuss to what extent the macroeconomic progress documented in Chapter  7 translated into rising living standards in Central, East and South-East Europe (CESEE) in the interwar period. Two questions will dominate. First, how did total population numbers develop between 1920 and 1939, and what were the driving factors? We will show that the economically advanced countries in the region such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Latvia exhibited a demographic experience similar to many West European countries at the time: the demographic transition came to an end and countries reached a new equilibrium of low popu- lation growth. By contrast, the poorer countries of the region experienced a late demographic transition with population growth rates of 1.5% per annum (and more) over a period of two decades. In a European perspective, countries such as the Soviet Union and Bulgaria were among the last ones to enter into and exit from this crucial transformational process. Second, how did living standards evolve over time? Living standards improved in all countries, but the catch-up with Western Europe remained limited when judged by income-based indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP) per cap- ita. A more positive assessment emerges only when other factors such as longevity and education are taken into account (so-called non-income-based living standard indicators). Diﬀerent types of living standard indicators point, in some cases, to dif- ferent conclusions for the same country. The Soviet Union will turn out to be such a case, where the widely used Historical Index of Human Development (HIHD) suggests a considerable improvement in the interwar period. How much credence should we give this ﬁnding in light of the 13 million human losses produced by 244 Matthias Morys and Martin Ivanov the 1918–1922 and 1932–1933 famines and the Great Terror of 1936–1938? (Cf. section 2.4 for details on these numbers.) Providing an answer will lead us to one of the most intriguing questions of 20th-century European economic history, which ﬁrst posed itself in the Soviet Union. What did forced structural change (collectivisation of agriculture and state- led industrialisation based on Five-Year Plans) mean for living standards? Was there only long-run gain, but at the expense of heavy short-term pain? Or did industriali- sation pay oﬀ relatively quickly, at least for the urban population? Structural change happened throughout CESEE in the interwar period, but it was particularly large than in the Soviet Union. We will try to ﬁnd an answer by means of comparing the Soviet Union with Bulgaria – two countries which stood at approximately the same level in 1913. Based on a large number of indicators, including wages and nutritional intake, we will show that the Bulgarian approach delivered higher liv- ing standards in the 1930s, whereas the short-term pain, including for the urban population, was considerable in the case of the Soviet Union. Countries included in this chapter and data availability The disintegration of the Habsburg and Romanov Empires during and at the end of World War I led to a doubling of CESEE countries compared to the 19th cen- tury – from 6 (Austria-Hungary, Russia, Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Romania) to 12 (in descending order of population for each group): Eastern Europe Central Europe South-East Europe Soviet Union Poland Romania Lithuania Czechoslovakia Yugoslavia Latvia Hungary Greece Estonia Bulgaria Albania Data availability is unproblematic except for the four small countries in our sam- ple (Albania, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and the Soviet Union. In the Albanian case, statistical material is generally in poor condition. The main reason for the pau- city of the Baltic data is the systematic neglect of their economic and social history as independent countries in the interwar period after their incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1940. There has been increased (and promising) research activity since regaining political independence in 1991, but more time will be needed to write the interwar economic and demographic history of the three Baltic countries. Data availability for the Soviet Union constitutes a problem of a very diﬀerent nature. Data are available but often not deemed trustworthy. For instance, scholars agree that deaths were under-reported during the two great famines of 1918–1922 and 1932–1933, but the exact size of the bias has remained controversial among scholars (cf. section 2.4). A great deal of this uncertainty stems from the censuses of 1937 and 1939. The Soviet authorities refused to publish the results of the Population and living standards 245 ﬁrst census, as it contained data the Soviet leadership was uncomfortable with (in particular the vast population losses in Ukraine in the 1932–1933 famine). They subsequently ordered a new census but manipulated many of its contents. Stalin conﬁdently referred in public to the main conclusions of the census even before the statisticians had ﬁnalised their work (Applebaum 2019: 376–379). Yet for present- day researchers, the 1939 census remains an important source to this day. Fortu- nately, a group of scholars led by Yurii Polyakov, a Russian historian and member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, published in 1992 the full census material behind the 1939 census (Polyakov 1992). While not changing the 1939 census in itself, the wider range of material available since 1992 points to diﬀerent conclusions. In the 1992 publication, for instance, the editors critically discuss in their introduction the total population ﬁgure of 170.1 million as recorded in the 1939 census and sug- gest as more plausible 167.6 million. In 2007, Polyakov also made the full census material of the (unpublished) 1937 census available (Polyakov 2007). Notwithstand- ing this important step towards historical accuracy, many problems persist with the Soviet data. More strongly than in any other country in our sample, the choice of the data itself is likely to determine the historical narrative in the case of the Soviet Union. With this important caveat in mind, we now proceed to describe and ana- lyse population trends for the CESEE countries in the interwar period. Population trends and late demographic transition Population trends Table  10.1 shows interwar population levels and growth rates for all 12 CESEE countries, diﬀerentiating between Central Europe, Eastern Europe and South-East Europe and comparing them to Western Europe. By Western Europe we mean the 30 West European countries listed in Maddison (2009) but excluding Greece (which we treat as a South-East European country, in line with the overall approach of this volume). As a more meaningful point of comparison, we divide Western Europe into core Western Europe (seven countries: Britain, France and Germany plus Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland), the Nordic countries (Denmark, Fin- land, Norway and Sweden) and Southern Europe (Italy, Portugal and Spain). The years 1920 and 1939 constitute natural boundaries of our analysis. The immediate post-war period exhibited considerable migration, typically related to the emergence of new nation states and border changes. By 1920 the majority of such movements had run their course, with the notable exceptions of Greece (at least 900,000 refugees following the 1922 Asia Minor catastrophe) and Latvia (approxi- mately 180,000 refugees from other parts of the late Tsarist Empire into the new state between political independence in 1918 and 1925). The last possible choice of year still unaﬀected by World War II is 1939 (population numbers are typically mid-year data). For the 12 CESEE countries, we rely on Rothenbacher (2002, 2013), who reports population numbers as well as vital rates (crude birth rate and crude death rate) on an annual basis. These two diﬀerent types of data allow us to calculate not only population growth rates (which includes migration patterns) but also natural 246 Matthias Morys and Martin IvanovTABLE 10.1Population in Europe in 1913, 1920 and 1939 and onset of fertility declinePanel A: Central, East and South-East Europe (CESEE)Eastern EuropeCentral EuropeSouth-East EuropeCESEE total SovietUnion Estonia Latvia Lithuania total Czechoslovakia Hungary Poland total Albania Bulgaria Greece Romania Yugoslavia totalPopulation (in million)1913133.23n.a.n.a.n.a.n.a.18.7n.a.n.a.4.54.87.33.0419201142.91.11.62.2147.8(30.4%)13.08.027.148.1(9.9%)0.84.85.015.512.038.1(7.8%)234.0(48.1%)19392174.21.12.02.6179.9(31.3%)14.79.234.858.7(10.2%)1.06.37.219.815.750.0(8.7%)288.6(50.2%)Average annual population growth 1920–1939 (in percent)1.00.61.21.11.00.70.81.41.11.61.41.91.31.41.31.1Average annual natural population growth 1920–1939 (in percent)1.65n.a.0.61.11.60.70.81.41.1n.a.1.51.21.31.41.31.4Onset of the fertility decline according to the European Fertility Project (year)192218991877n.a.190319101909n.a.1912191319081911 Population and living standards 247Panel B: Western EuropeWestern Europe(29 countries6)EuropetotalCore Western Europe7(7 countries)Southern Europe8(3 countries)Nordic countries9(4 countries)Population (in million)1913255.61920252.4(51.9%)486.4(100%)171.464.714.91939285.4(49.8%)574.0(100%)187.277.016.8Average annual population growth 1920–1939 (in percent)0.6%0.9%0.5%0.9%0.6%Onset of the fertility decline according to the European Fertility Project (year)France 1827Belgium 1881Switzerland 1887Germany 1888England 1892Italy 1913Portugal 1916Spain 1920Denmark 1898Sweden 1902Norway 1903Sources: Population numbers: Rothenbacher (2002) and Rothenbacher (2013) for 12 CESEE countries, except for 1913 population on the territory of the later Soviet Union (Markevich & Harrison 2011) and 1913 population of Serbia (Austrian National Bank 2014).

Subtracting the two from each other delivers the net migration rate: (1) net migration rate = population growth rate − natural population growth rate Multiplying the net migration rate with the population of the particular year gives net migration: (2) net migration = net migration rate × mid-year population In the cases of Greece and Latvia, for instance, average annual population growth between 1920 and 1939 was considerably higher than natural population growth rates for the reasons alluded to earlier (Table  10.1). Distinguishing between the two indicators is important, as typically the natural population growth rate is more relevant to understanding the demographic experience. It is precisely for this addi- tional information that we have preferred the Rothenberger data over possible alternatives such as Bardet and Dupâquier (1999). Only in the cases of Albania and Estonia can this distinction not be made for the lack of data on vital rates. The European population grew from 486.4  million to 574.0  million in the interwar period (18%, or 0.9% p.a.). Yet population growth was highly uneven across the continent. It grew at roughly half the speed in the West compared to the East (0.6% vs. 1.1%). The divergent demographic dynamics allowed CESEE to overtake in absolute population numbers in the interwar period (48.1% of total European population in 1920, but 50.2% in 1939), almost certainly for the ﬁrst time in European history. There also were pronounced diﬀerences within the two halves. The natural population growth rates for core Western Europe and the Nor- dic countries were as low as 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively, but it reached 0.9% for Southern Europe. A similar divergence is encountered in CESEE, where Central Europe grew the slowest and Eastern Europe the fastest, with South-East Europe falling in the middle. Yet stark regional diﬀerences can wither away in a country- by-country comparison. Latvia (0.6%), Czechoslovakia (0.7%) and Hungary (0.8%), for instance, grew at rates comparable to core Western Europe. The concept of the demographic transition The unifying framework to understand cross-country diﬀerences and similarities in population dynamics is the theory of the demographic transition. In essence, while all European countries went through this transformational process, many CESEE countries experienced a late but rapid demographic transition whose cru- cial intermediate phase – fertility still high but mortality already low – took place during the interwar period. In the following, we will ﬁrst explain the concept of the demographic transition. Then we will provide statistical evidence according to which some CESEE economies entered the transition at around the time that the core Western European countries did, whereas others came late in the process. Population and living standards 249 Finally, we will explain the well-researched cases of Bulgaria and the Soviet Union, the two countries with the highest natural population growth rates in our sample, and ask how they were able to sustain such high rates. The theory of the demographic transition posits that countries will move through three distinct states in the course of their economic development (Livi-Bacci 2007: 101, ﬁgure 4.2; Chesnais 1992). Initially, population growth is low (or even absent), as high birth rates are oﬀset by high death rates. High mortality is the result of epidemics, harvest failures, poor sanitation and insuﬃcient medical care, and it aﬀects infants (children of up to 12 months of age) in particular. The demographic equilibrium of this stage sub- sequently unravels as mortality declines but fertility remains high, resulting in substantial population growth. The exact reasons for the mortality decline have been a matter of debate, with some emphasising “collective” factors (and improvements in public health and overall hygienic conditions in particular) and others stressing “individual” contribu- tions (and better nutrition in particular) (cf. Deaton 2006). Crucially, the long-term decline in mortality started in the second half of the 19th century throughout Europe, with only a limited connection to the level of economic development in a particular country. After a slow start in the late 19th century, the decline was step by step and perva- sive between 1914 and 1945. Figure 10.1 shows this pattern for Bulgaria, where mortal- ity halved over ﬁve decades (28.8 per thousand in 1893 vs. 13.5 per thousand in 1939). 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 1890 1895 1900 1905 1910 1915 1920 1925 1930 1935 1940 Fertility Mortality Natural population growth rate FIGURE 10.1 Vital rates of Bulgaria, 1890–1940. Sources: Own calculations based on Bulgarian Statistical Yearbooks, various issues. Notes: Vital rates are 3-year moving averages of annual data spanning 1889–1941. Data are interpolated for 1913–1919. 250 Matthias Morys and Martin Ivanov Finally, fertility rates decline to prevent excessive population growth; conse- quently, the country reaches a new equilibrium (that is, zero or low population growth) characterised by both low mortality and fertility rates. Not unlike the mor- tality decline, the exact reasons for the decline in fertility have remained more controversial. In the schematic version of the demographic transition, the mortality decline not only precedes the fertility decline but drives it: the reduction in fertil- ity is interpreted as an endogenous response to the mortality decline in “nature’s attempt” to re-establish sustainable population growth rates. Yet two objections can be raised against such a simple mechanism. On a theoretical level, how and why would household decisions on oﬀspring be driven by the macroeconomic rationale to lower population growth? Furthermore, the mortality decline in itself might be driven by the decline in fertility: fertility decline often involved longer spaces between births, thereby reducing infant mortality. On an empirical level, several well-studied cases (in particular on the French demographic experience) showed that the fertility decline often occurred before or coincided with the mortality decline. Consequently, a sizeable body of literature has developed to explain the fertility decline independent of the mortality decline (for an overview, cf. Guinnane 2011). Some of these theories emphasise costs, be they direct costs (e.g. raising children in cities might be more expensive than in the countryside) or opportunity costs (e.g. industrial work created new opportunities and trade-oﬀs for women by oﬀering better-paying work that could not be combined easily with child-mind- ing); others focus on changes in social insurance and old-age support or innova- tions in contraceptive methods. All of these theories interpret the fertility decline as the result of modernisation (broadly deﬁned), and many of them rely on the twin processes of urbanisation and industrialisation. Unfortunately, most of this literature reﬂects the historical experiences of Western Europe and North Amer- ica. Future research will need to apply their analytical questions to the CESEE experience. The timing of the demographic transition in CESEE Given the competing theories on the fertility decline but the lack of relevant stud- ies on the CESEE experience, it seems prudent to establish ﬁrst when this process commenced in the various CESEE countries. For this purpose, we draw on the results and the data of the European Fertility Project (EFP). This large-scale pro- ject, centred around Princeton University and conducted between 1963 and 1986, aimed at understanding the demographic transition in all European countries dur- ing the 19th and 20th centuries, with the main focus on understanding the pattern and the timing of the fertility decline. While not all aspects of the EFP have found universal support (Brown & Guinnane 2007), it remains unchallenged in terms of width and depth of coverage in analysing the fertility transition on the regional level. A key ﬁnding was that before the onset of the fertility decline, regions tended to have their own fertility plateau which often remained remarkably stable over Population and living standards 251 decades if not centuries. Yet once the decline had begun (deﬁned as a 10% decline from the initial fertility plateau; for details, cf. Coale & Watkins 1986: 37–41), the fertility transition became irreversible. Fertility rates would continue to fall for a prolonged period of time, after which they would stabilise on a new, much lower level. Table 10.1 also provides the date of the fertility decline (for the most part directly from the EFP calculations but partly complemented by own calculations based on the methodology and the data provided by the EFP). The decisive fertility decline for most core West European countries took place in the 1880s but started only two decades later in CESEE. It began in the 1900s in Central Europe, was followed approximately a decade later in South-East Europe and another ten years later in European Russia (EFP data are conﬁned to the European part of the country). Consequently, the much higher interwar population growth in CESEE is largely explained by their late demographic transition. Crucially, there was considerable regional variation within CESEE (as there was in other parts of Europe). In the 73 provinces included for Hungary, for instance, the onset of the fertility decline stretched over a full eight decades from 1850 to 1930, yet on the aggregate level the 10% decline from the initial fertility plateau took place only in 1910 (Coale & Watkins 1986: 38). Large cities often played an important pioneering role in the fertility transition. For instance, while European Russia as a whole experienced the onset of the fertility transition only in 1922, its capital city St. Petersburg did so as early as the 1870s (Moscow: 1886). Other regional early comers include the Russian provinces of Kurland (1869) and Livonia (1886), which after World War I  came to form the nucleus of Latvia. The Latvian case – for which we report the average value of the two constituent provinces in Table 10.1 – demonstrates that the CESEE countries with a relatively early demographic transition hardly diﬀered from the West European experience. Czechoslovakia and Hungary  – incidentally the most economically advanced CESEE countries at the time – fell into the same category. What really requires an explanation is the experience of the CESEE latecomers to the fertility transition: how can we explain that countries such as Bulgaria and the Soviet Union were able to accommodate a natural population growth rate of 1.5% and above for such an extended period of time? The late demographic transition in the Soviet Union and in Bulgaria The Bulgarian case nicely demonstrates the interaction between overall economic development of the country and its demography. It appears to be one of the argua- bly rather rare (Guinnane 2011) standard cases where the dramatic mortality decline beginning in the 1890s eventually forced a change in reproductive behaviour and a fall in fertility. Yet this was a long-drawn-out process, and for a long period the essentially agrarian economy was able to absorb rising population numbers. To begin with, for more than three decades (mid-1890s to late 1920s) the population 252 Matthias Morys and Martin Ivanov grew at more than 1.5% per year (Figure 10.1), almost doubling the population from 3.3 million to 5.7 million. Constant (and indeed increasing) fertility until the early 20th century can be interpreted as a demographic response to the agricultural demand created by industrialisation in Western Europe (cf. Chapter 3 by Kopsidis and Schulze in this volume). In the Bulgarian case, the international demand for agriculture was satisﬁed by an extensiﬁcation of agriculture rather than an intensiﬁcation. Given the relative poverty of the peasants and the high interest rates they faced, farmers were not able to introduce more capital per unit of land in order to meet the growing (foreign) demand for wheat, barley and maize. Instead, they adopted low-cost, labour-intensive methods of farming coupled with increasing fertility which allowed them to cul- tivate hitherto unused plots of land for export. Such extensiﬁcation was possible only because of extremely low initial population densities of about 30 people per square kilometer during the 1870s. Common pastures and forests constituted an additional reservoir of “free” land which was also put under the plough. Accord- ing to recent calculations (Lyberatos 2011: 146) the arable land almost doubled between roughly 1870 and 1910. Yet this process was bound to come to an end by its very nature. Land became even more scarce after World War I, when several hundred thousand ethnic Bul- garians from the neighbouring countries were forced to ﬂee to Bulgaria. Cou- pled with the global agricultural crisis of the interwar period, the situation of the farming population became increasingly diﬃcult and incomes stagnated. In this situation, where new lands could no longer be secured, the only solution was to increase agricultural productivity (on henceforth constant land) and to limit fertil- ity (in order to prevent parcelisation in the next generation). Thus, in the Bulgar- ian case at least, the schematic version of the demographic transition (i.e. that the decline in mortality will eventually force a fertility decline) still seems to hold. By contrast, the case of Russia and the Soviet Union is extraordinarily complex. Three partially overlapping aspects preclude a straightforward interpretation. First, in addition to World War I and the 1918–1921 Russian Civil War, there were two major famines (1918–1922 and 1932–1933) and Stalin’s Great Terror (1936–1938). These three events resulted, by any account, in millions of premature deaths, but the exact numbers have remained the subject of scholarly debate. Frequently used numbers are 6 million, 6 million (roughly half in the Ukraine alone) and 1 million for these three demographic catastrophes, respectively, but estimates diﬀer widely (O’Grada 2009: 233–241; Allen 2003: 114–115). Second, scholars disagree on the numbers, as much hinges on assumptions about the under-registration of deaths at the time. This in turn has brought much of the statistical evidence into disrepute (for an overview of the controversial discussion, cf. the ﬁrst six articles in the Slavic Review, vol. 58 (1999), issue 1). We already mentioned in the introduction to this chapter the censuses of 1937 and 1939. The ﬁrst was suppressed by Stalin and the second was published, but only in embellished form. Finally, some key developments are open to alternative interpretations, with important implications on where the Soviet Union stood in the 1930s with respect Population and living standards 253 to the demographic transition. In particular, the substantial fertility decline in the mid-1930s, before returning to much higher levels in the late 1930s, has received diﬀerent treatment. Allen (2003: 113, 115) brings the fertility decline in connec- tion with the industrialisation and urbanisation stemming from Stalin’s ﬁrst Five- Year Plan in 1928, while leaving open the reasons for the sizeable fertility rebound in the late 1930s (1927 peak: 45.8; 1934 trough: 30.0; 1937 peak: 40.0). O’Grada (2009: 237), by contrast, views the mid-1930s fertility trough as a consequence of the 1932–1933 famine (i.e. the famine not only increased mortality but also decreased fertility); in this view, the late 1930s fertility rebound was a “return to normal” for a country which found itself still in the early stages of the demographic transition. As the collectivisation and the associated high grain procurements con- tributed to the 1932–1933 famine, it is easy to see that the perspective on the early Soviet Union’s demographic experience is often closely tied to the view of a particular scholar on the broader economic transformation under Stalin’s ﬁrst two Five-Year Plans (1928–1937). What then is a possible “minimalist” interpretation in the face of such uncer- tainty? Following sizeable human losses in World War I, the Russian Civil War (1918–1921) and the post-war famine (1918–1922), population growth in all like- lihood resumed only after 1923. Yet it is not until the ﬁrst Soviet census of 1926 that population numbers and vital rates can be established with greater accuracy (Markevich & Harrison 2011: 675–679). We therefore conﬁne our discussion to 1926–1939, for which Rothenbacher (2013) calculates an average natural popula- tion growth rate of 1.6% – a very high number which (as opposed to the Bulgar- ian case) shows no tendency to fall towards the end of the period. Fertility rates (deemed more trustworthy than mortality numbers) remained close to 40 per one thousand immediately before World War II; while they had come down from the 50 per one thousand from four decades earlier, fertility remained much higher than in any other CESEE country at the time (Romania, the country with the second- highest fertility, stood at 29.8 per one thousand in 1938). Likewise, while there was a clear downward movement in mortality (a trend which even the crude death rates of the two world wars, the two famines and the Great Terror cannot obfus- cate; cf. Wheatcroft 1999: 38), mortality values in the interwar period remained higher compared to all other CESEE countries bar Romania. In sum, the Soviet Union experienced a retarded demographic transition even by the standards of the CESEE countries. Can this assessment be squared with the positive evaluation of the Soviet demo- graphic experience proposed by Allen? (2003: 111–131). In his view, education, economic development and rising living standards were the main factors responsi- ble for smaller families and slower population growth in the Soviet Union, thereby avoiding a population explosion on the scale of 20th-century India (the refer- ence point chosen by Allen). While this interpretation has much to commend, it strongly relies on taking a larger period of time into account. Only in the 1950s did mortality in the Soviet Union fall below Central and South-East European levels (Millward & Baten 2010: 234) and fertility converge with the country’s Western 254 Matthias Morys and Martin Ivanov neighbours. Seen in isolation, the interwar period only shows the early signs of the demographic transition in the Soviet Union, and connecting this process in an unequivocal way to industrialisation and urbanisation after 1928 is probably not possible. As we will see again in the section on living standards, the Allen perspec- tive relies too strongly on the urban areas; they were growing and changing rapidly at the time, but the overall dynamics, including demography, were still driven pre- dominantly by the countryside. Living standards Living standard indicators can be classiﬁed into two broad categories: income- related measures and non-income-related measures. In assessing well-being across countries and over time, it is often instructive to draw on both, as they might well convey a diﬀerent message. Only taken together will they give an adequate picture of living standards. In the following, we will sketch the theoretical concepts behind GDP per capita and the Human Development Index (HDI) as the two most widely used indicators (section 3.1) and then show potentials and pitfalls of both measures when applying them to the CESEE interwar experience (section 3.2). We will ﬁnd neither indicator fully convincing in measuring the living standard of the rapidly developing CESEE economies. Not only are they highly aggregate, but they cannot capture, by design, what was arguably the most important feature of the CESEE economies at the time: the rural-urban divide and the structural transformation of essentially agrarian economies towards a larger share of industry. Sections 3.3 and 3.4 address both issues. Based on data for life expectancy, literacy and school enrolment, we will outline the fundamental changes undergone by all CESEE countries in the interwar period. We will then pay particular attention to the rural-urban divide, focusing on the Soviet Union and Bulgaria as two iconic examples of diﬀerent developmental trajectories. Was “big push industrialisation” à la Stalin better for living standards than the more conventional approach pursued by Bulgaria? GDP per capita and the Human Development Index (HDI) as living standard indicators The basic idea of income-centred welfare measures is that command over com- modities matters most in assessing well-being: income is an argument in any indi- vidual’s utility function, and a rise in real income means an increase in welfare. The most important such measure is real GDP per capita as taken from national accounts and population statistics. The ready availability of this type of data (for the post–World War II period anyway) partly explains the continued attraction of GDP per capita for comparative studies, and it remains the most popular measure to this day. Yet income-centred measures have been criticised for a long time, partly on practical and partly on more substantive grounds. On a practical level, GDP per Population and living standards 255 capita has been seen as blind to income inequality and unduly concerned with income rather than consumption. Solutions to such objections have been found in a wide range of minor (and sometimes major) modiﬁcations to GDP per capita, such as multiplying the measure with one minus the country’s Gini coeﬃcient (the Gini coeﬃcient is a standard measure of income distribution, where an equal income distribution is attributed a value of zero; the more unequal the distribution, the higher the value, with an upper bound of unity). A more fundamental challenge to GDP per capita as a living standard indicator arose from the capability school of Nobel laureate Amartya Sen (born 1933). In this view, human development – that is, the human progression of an individual over time – is seen as the overriding purpose of (the macreconomic process of) eco- nomic development. This approach is often framed in terms of whether people are able to “be” and “do” desirable things in life (beings: well fed, sheltered, healthy; doings: work, education, voting, participating in community life). Consequently, underdevelopment is perceived as the lack of certain basic capabilities rather than lack of income per se. In this framework, “well-being” has to do with being well (as opposed to having the ﬁnancial means to spend on something): Do people live long? Do they escape preventable morbidity? Are they literate, allowing them to lead more purposeful lives? Are they free from hunger and undernourishment? Put diﬀerently, while GDP per capita is essentially a macroeconomic indicator (except for the very last step, i.e., dividing by population), the capability school searches for measures that conceptually begin with the individual. The most important measure emanating from this alternative view of well-being is the Human Development Index (HDI), as inspired by the work of the develop- ment economist Mahbub ul Haq (1934–1998) and used in the (annual) Human Development Report of the United Nations Development Programme. While the HDI has undergone several important changes since the ﬁrst Human Development Report in 1990, it has continued to give equal weight to indicators for (1) longev- ity, (2) knowledge and (3) income (the latter in clear concession to the income- centred measures of well-being). Longevity has consistently been proxied by life expectancy at birth. Knowledge was initially measured by the weighted average of adult literacy (two-thirds weighting) and gross enrolment (one-third weighting). This particular speciﬁcation of the knowledge indicator came to create problems over time, as adult literacy rates in most countries approached 100% and even gross enrolment rates converged remarkably among countries. Consequently, the 2010 Human Development Report dropped literacy altogether and replaced enrolment rates (a ﬂow variable looking only at currently enrolled pupils and students) with “mean years of schooling” (expected years of schooling for those in school and mean years of schooling obtained for those out of it). Switching to mean years of schooling is more consequential than meets the eye initially. As a stock vari- able of educational attainment, it preserves for a long-time diﬀerences in school- ing in periods past: it makes it more diﬃcult for countries with previously poor educational systems to catch up. The 2010 changes to the “knowledge” variable helped reintroduce heterogeneity into the data. Finally, income has consistently 256 Matthias Morys and Martin Ivanov been measured as GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP) in diﬀerent countries. Each of the three components is given equal weight and is measured in terms of percentage of the distance travelled between an assumed minimum (“natural zero”) and assumed maximum value (“aspirational target”). In the case of life expectancy, for instance, 20 years acts as a “natural zero” based on historical evidence that no country in the 20th century had a life expectancy of less than 20 years. Maximum life expectancy is set at 85, a realistic target for many countries today. Having deﬁned minimum and maximum values, the dimension indices are calculated as: dimension index  =  (actual value − minimum value)/(maximum value − minimum value) or, applied to life expectancy: longevity index = (life expectancy of country X − 20)/(85 − 20) In addition to a new proxy for knowledge since 2010, two more changes have been introduced over time. First, the arithmetic average has been replaced by the geometric average of the three individual indicators as a means to ensure that equal development along all three dimensions is reﬂected in a higher HDI value. Second, it has been argued that each dimension should be treated as non-linear. Increasing income from $15,000 to $45,000 will be easier than increasing it from $45,000 to $75,000 ($75,000 in 2011 PPP is the assumed maximum value in the 2019 Human Development Report). Consequently, a logarithmic form has been introduced which “rewards” countries more strongly for achievements at the upper end than at the lower end. income index = (ln(GDP per capita in country X) − ln(100))/(ln(75,000) − ln (100)) The Human Development Report in its current form applies such discounting at the lower end only to the income indicator. Yet the same logic applies in princi- ple to the other two indicators: for example increasing life expectancy from 25 to 55 years will be much easier than extending it from 55 to 85 years. The Historical Index of Human Development (HIHD) of Prados de la Escosura (2015) The most systematic attempt in recent years to import the methodology of the HDI into the ﬁeld of economic history is by Prados de la Escosura (2015), who constructs a Historical Index of Human Development (HIHD) for 96 countries from 1870 to 2015 (with the number of countries rising to 164 for the latter periods). Adopting the HDI principles but adjusting them to the requirements of Population and living standards 257 historical data, he forms three indicators similar to the pre-2010 HDI: LEB (lon- gevity: life expectancy at birth), EDU (knowledge/education: literacy and enrol- ment, with equal weighting) and UNY (income: adjusted income per capita). Each of the three indicators (and not only income, as in the case of the current HDI) is subject to a logarithmic transformation, rewarding achievements at the upper end more strongly. The values obtained for the three components are then aggregated by forming the geometric average: HIHD = LEB 1/3 EDU 1/3 UNY 1/3 Table 10.2 provides data for GDP per capita and the HIHD for nine CESEE countries for selected benchmark years. The Baltic countries are excluded for the lack of GDP estimates. In the case of the upper panel, we also exclude Albania and Romania for the reasons discussed in Chapter 7. By contrast, Prados de la Escosura (2015) deems the GDP data for both countries of suﬃcient quality and produces HIHD estimates. We add data for Britain, Germany, Italy and Sweden as points of comparison (Table 10.3). The two indicators exhibit important similarities. First, Czechoslovakia and Hungary oﬀered the highest standard of living both in the beginning and at the end of the interwar period. Living standards rose more rapidly in some of the other countries, but their initial lead was suﬃciently strong to maintain their overall position (with Czechoslovakia marginally better than Hungary). Second, certainly until the late 1920s and potentially well into the 1930s, living standards (and overall economic development) continued to follow a well-established, longer-term pat- tern documented in Chapters 3 and 6 of this volume for the 1800–1914 period: the standard of living in Central Europe was higher than in East and South-East Europe. Greece was the ﬁrst country to break out from this pattern in the 1930s, at least in comparison to Poland. Third, living standards in CESEE continued to lag behind not only countries such as Britain and Germany but also Southern Euro- pean and Nordic countries such as Italy and Sweden. Yet there also are crucial diﬀerences between the indicators, two of which are particularly important in our context and will propel us to go beyond aggregate measures (sections 3.3 and 3.4). First, an income-centred approach suggests hardly any relative improvement in CESEE living standards vis-à-vis Britain (the European country with the highest income level at the time). Czechoslovakia and Hungary, for instance, caught up only marginally but remained below 50% of British income levels throughout the interwar period. Convergence forces were stronger elsewhere (Soviet Union, Greece), but this partly reﬂected lower initial levels. By contrast, HIHD gains throughout the region were higher than for Britain, and often by a considerable margin. This suggests that economically backward countries typically ﬁnd it easier to improve health conditions and educational achievements rather than to close the income gap with advanced economies. The relative position of Russia and the Soviet Union constitutes the other important discrepancy between the two indicators.

Population and living standards 259 Russia’s HIHD was consistently the lowest of all CESEE countries,1 yet by World War I  the country had achieved a mid-range per head income: lower than the (nascent) Central European countries but higher than some of the Balkan coun- tries (cf. Chapter 3). Three decades of rapid industrialisation starting in the 1880s resulted in high growth rates but transformed mostly a small number of (rapidly growing) urban centres. Late Tsarist Russia made few inroads into the countryside, and life expectancy, literacy rates and school enrolment for the vast majority of the population remained far behind the Central European and even the South-East European economies. Yet, according to Table 10.2, a role reversal had occurred by the late 1930s. Rapid economic growth continued (though interrupted by World War I and the Russian Civil War; cf. Chapter 7), and increasingly translated into better living standards for the population at large. The HIHD suggests that by 1938, the Soviet Union oﬀered the third-highest living standard after Czecho- slovakia and Hungary. In recent years, Allen (1998, 2003) has interpreted similar TABLE 10.3 Living standard indicators for the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Sweden, interwar period United Kingdom Germany Italy Sweden Panel A: GDP per capita.

Should we concur with this revisionist assessment of Bob Allen? Or should we side with the conventional view which argues that any meaning- ful improvement of living standards in the Soviet Union materialised only in the 1950s? Finding an answer to the controversial question of living standards in the early Soviet Union is important but diﬃcult. Collectivisation of agriculture, state-led industrialisation and Five-Year Plans were ﬁrst implemented there (after 1928), but they became the template for the entire region after World War II. Consequently, the 1930s allow a comparison between two diﬀerent development paths for a last time: “big push industrialisation” in the Soviet Union versus a process of slower, market-led structural transformation which we will refer to as “organic growth.” Developing our own position will require going beyond aggregate measures, which reveal as much as they conceal. Even Allen (2003: 132–152), the protagonist of a more positive assessment of living standards in the Soviet Union, does not claim that the standard of living improved throughout the country. His work is solely concerned with cities and urban areas, and his argument is more subtle: he concedes that living standards in the cities might not have improved a great deal, yet he argues that Stalin’s policies unleashed a large movement from the country- side to the cities, allowing a larger number of people to take advantage of a better urban life. Aggregate measures not only assume a homogeneity that was absent in the interwar period. They also make it more diﬃcult to understand the CESEE experience, where heterogeneity was the deﬁning feature we need to understand. We will ﬁrst disaggregate the HIHD into its components (section 3.3). What do the individual indicators suggest about absolute and relative living standards? Sec- ond, we need to understand better the diﬀerences between cities and countryside in a region that was essentially rural and agricultural but became – in all parts, not only in the Soviet Union – increasingly urban and industrial (section 3.4). Evaluating living standards beyond aggregate measures Decomposing the HIHD of Prados de la Escosura (2015) reveals that its compo- nent time series often do not rely on country-speciﬁc historical data. Instead, they constitute proxy measures based on assumed similarities to neighbouring countries (or even to countries in the same “region”). For example life expectancy data are reported for all 12 CESEE countries, but only for three of them are they based on historical data pertaining to the particular country (Srb 1962 for Czechoslovakia, Valaoras 1960 for Greece and Pressat 1985 for the Soviet Union). Such an approach might be legitimate for global comparisons in which regions are compared with each other, yet it is of little use in a study speciﬁcally devoted to Eastern Europe.

Typically, census data are used to produce life expectancy estimates. Russia and the Soviet Union are a good case in point. The three observations shown in Table 10.3 for 1896/1897, 1926/1927 and 1938/1939 build on the three censuses of 1897, 1926 and 1939. For the other seven coun- tries, the data are of less use for establishing long-term patterns. Estonia, Albania and Yugoslavia, for instance, oﬀer only a single observation for the entire interwar period. Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania constitute intermediate cases as far as data coverage is concerned.

All other entries are from the data underlying Prados de la Escosura (2015). 264 Matthias Morys and Martin Ivanov Life expectancy at birth Life expectancy remained far below the values for other European countries but improved considerably over time, both in absolute and relative terms. It is worth beginning with Albania, where life expectancy at birth remained below 40 years as late as 1938. This constitutes the lowest value recorded for any European country by this point (Rothenbacher 2013, 2002). The Soviet Union exhibited the second lowest value in the region and allows to establish a pattern of consistent longevity increases: 32.0 years in 1896/1897 to 44.3 years in 1926/1927 and 46.8 years in 1938/1939. Longevity patterns look more benign for all other countries. Greece, for which the longest record is available, gained 18 years over six decades, or 50% (from 36.7 to 54.4 years). Britain and Germany, over the same period, achieved 19.8 and 24.8, respectively (Britain, from 45.1 years in 1880 to 64.9 in 1938; Germany, from 39.4 to 64.2 over the same time span). By the late 1930s, the top-performing economies (Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Greece, and potentially also Latvia and Estonia) also had the highest life expectancies. What light does Table 10.4 shed on the controversial question of living standards under Stalin’s rapid industrialisation? Two comparisons are relevant. First, longevity increases in the Soviet Union slowed down after 1927 – precisely during the period which revisionists claim led to a signiﬁcant improvement of living standards (Allen 1998). Second, both Bulgaria and Greece oﬀer observations at roughly the same points in the 1920s and the 1930s, but longevity increases were considerably higher in these two cases (Greece, 9.7 years; Bulgaria, 5.5 years; Soviet Union, 2.5 years). Longevity improvements in the early Soviet Union do not look impressive in a regional perspective. Literacy and school enrolment Literacy is deﬁned as the percentage of the population aged 15 years or over that is able to read and write. Enrolment rates are the number of pupils divided by the relevant school age population cohort (typically children aged 5–14 years). While diﬀerent in theory, the two indicators are in practice highly correlated, not least because in the absence of historical data, literacy rates are often projected back- wards with the rate of primary enrolment. Entries in bold in Tables 10.5 and 10.6 are taken from two standard references with pan-European coverage, namely Flora (1973) for literacy and Lindert (2004) for school enrolment. We add to this, in normal script, data coming from a variety of sources, containing typically data belonging to one country only. The pan- European and country-speciﬁc data ﬁt nicely and validate each other. The Czech provinces of Austria (Bohemia and Moravia) and Hungary led on education for a long time, with a notable diﬀerence between the two. Austria’s ﬁrst attempt at establishing a modern educational system dates back to 1774, but compulsory schooling in both Austria and Hungary began only in the late 1860s (Berend  & Ranki 1974: 24). Practice diﬀered from theory, as evidenced from enrolment rates, but the upward trend is clear. Population and living standards 265 How do we account for the slow rise of schooling in the rest of Eastern Europe? For a long time, there was no particular need for a literate workforce. The bulk of the population performed agricultural work in a rural context. The history of the emerging Balkan nation states suggests that education was not, or only partly, a means to foster skills and productivity; full command over the language was ﬁrst and foremost important in pushing back competing nationalisms (Mishkova 1994). The literacy rates demonstrate this pattern, with countries obtaining autonomy/ independence earlier (Greece, 1832; Romania, 1859; Bulgaria, 1878) also exhibit- ing earlier increases in literacy. The absence of this nation-building element helps explain why literacy rates remained so low in Russia, where ordinary people saw little value in acquiring reading skills until the abolishment of serfdom in 1861 (Mironov 1991; Chaudhary et al. 2012). Only at around the turn of the century had all CESEE countries introduced compulsory schooling, but even then actual enrolment probably did not surpass a third (outside of Austria-Hungary). By World War I, only the Czech provinces had achieved near-universal literacy and schooling, with Hungary following at a certain distance. In all other countries, literacy remained low by European standards. By World War I, none of them had probably surpassed the 50% threshold; and even by 1930 many of them had not yet reached two-thirds. But then, by means of substantial investment into primary and secondary schooling, literacy and school enrolment increased quickly. By the end of the interwar period, most countries had achieved near-universal literacy (Benavot & Riddle 1988). Indicators speaking to rural-urban divide and structural transformation Yet even breaking down the HIHD index into its components leaves us with measures which do not speak to distinctions which greatly mattered for people’s lives. Literacy, for instance, averages over substantial diﬀerences between male and female, urban versus rural, diﬀerent age cohorts, various national and religious groups within one country, and diﬀerent regions and estates (in Tsarist Russia), to name but the most important dimensions. For example Mironov’s (1991: 243) data suggest that Russia’s urban population in 1920 was twice as literate as the rural population (73.5% vs. 37.8%). Other indicators frequently used in the living stand- ard debate are arguably even less representative. Real wages are a good example: they reﬂect urban working conditions that were not relevant for more than 25% of the working population in interwar CESEE. The bulk of the population worked in agriculture, and they either worked their own land as subsistence farmers (and hence earned no salary) or they received a salary in addition to remuneration in kind (the size of which we do not know). The examples of literacy and wages challenge us to explore in greater detail the rural-urban divide. On the micro level, this divide stands for living standard diﬀer- ences between the cities and the countryside. On the macro level, it explains the speed of structural transformation. Both are connected: poor rural living standards will act as a push factor to the cities, and high urban living standards will act as a 266 Matthias Morys and Martin Ivanov pull factor. In the following, we will draw on ﬁve speciﬁc indicators that speak to the diﬀerences between rural and urban areas: urbanisation and shares of sectoral output as macro indicators of structural change (Tables 10.7 and 10.8), and literacy rates, wages and calorie intake as living standard indicators (Tables 10.9 and 10.10; Figure 10.2). We conﬁne ourselves to two countries, namely the Soviet Union and Bulgaria. We include the Soviet Union as we are speciﬁcally interested in the impact of collectivisation and forced industrialisation on living standards. We choose Bul- garia as arguably the most suitable point of comparison. Both countries had a particularly low income position in 1913 (Chapter 3) and were held up already by Gerschenkron (1962) as quintessential cases of economically backward countries. Both also underwent a late demographic transition, with high population growth in the interwar period. As explained in section  2.4, this forced a change in the Bulgarian growth model from extensiﬁcation to intensiﬁcation of agriculture and absorbing rural surplus population into the cities.

Towns are typically deﬁned as having more than 5,000 inhabitants. Deﬁnitions may vary (e.g., oﬃcial classiﬁcation as “town” for historical reasons), but the Bulgarian data – with its three diﬀerent deﬁnitions – suggest that such minor diﬀerences do not matter for the broad point made in this chapter. Population and living standards 267 saw structural transformation as the result of economic and demographic pressures (Ivanov & Tooze 2007). We will ask, from a living standard perspective, how this compares to the Soviet Union’s big push industrialisation. How much higher was the speed of structural transformation in the Soviet Union? Good indicators are urbanisation levels and the share of industry as part of GDP. Table 10.7 compares urbanisation levels in both countries from 1870 to World War II. In the early 1920s both countries were rural economies, with only 1 in 5 living in towns. Yet the Soviet Union increased this number by 15% between 1926 and 1939 (a period roughly coinciding with the ﬁrst two Five-Year Plans implemented between 1928 and 1937), while Bulgaria advanced by less than 5%. The share of the secondary sector as part of GDP points to the same conclusion. Both indicators suggest that structural transformation progressed much quicker in the Soviet Union than in Bulgaria. What did rapid structural change mean for the two-thirds of the Soviet popula- tion still living in rural areas by the outbreak of World War II? There is a dearth of quantitative studies on this question, and protagonists of a more positive assessment of the living standard in the early Soviet Union have conﬁned their work suspi- ciously to the cities. One of the few available indicators is literacy. Until World War I, the Bulgarian population, both rural and urban, was more literate (Table  10.9). But then the Soviet Union overtook and subsequently widened the gap both in TABLE 10.9 Literacy rates in Russia/the Soviet Union and Bulgaria, 1897–1946 1890s 1920s 1st. obs. 1920s 2nd obs. 1930s 1940 Russia/Soviet Union 1897 1920 1926 1939 urban 52.3 68.5 76.3 89.5 rural 19.6 32.8 45.2 76.7 total 24.0 39.1 51.1 81.2 Bulgaria 1900 1920 1926 1934 1946 urban 54.6 62.9 64.1 69.5 86.8 rural 28.5 39.9 43.6 51.9 73.7 total 33.5 44.5 47.9 55.6 77.0 Sources: Bulgaria: Own calculations for 1900, 1920, 1926, 1934, and 1946 are based on census publica- tions: Obshti rezultati ot prebroyavane na naselenieto v Tsarstvo Balgaria na 31 dekemvrii 1910 god.

This might suggest that while Stalin’s policies were primarily concerned with the cities, they were not conﬁned to them: the government aimed at raising human capital as a precondition for economic growth in urban and rural areas alike. Yet it is also possible that the high value for rural literacy simply is an exaggeration (it goes back to the controversial 1939 census; cf. section 1) and that living standards in the countryside remained appallingly low in the 1930s, in line with the conventional literature on this topic (which is largely based on anecdotal evidence). After all, keeping living standards low in the countryside would force people to leave for the cities, providing the workforce for the new industries. We will return to the logic of this developmental approach for the case of Bulgaria, TABLE 10.10 Daily calorie intake per adult person in Bulgaria, 1848–1963 1848 1884 1906 1925 1936 1939 1941 1963 peasant (rural) 3044 3753 3408 3785 4079 2920 worker (urban) 1934 2562 3314 clerck (urban) 2432 3201 Sources: Own calculations based on Todorov, N. ‘Budgetat na balgarskoto rabotnichesko semeistvo ot sredata na XX v.’, V chest na akademik D.

We used original quantities of foods and drinks from the source to which we have applied the same caloric values described above, rather than borrow- ing the oﬃcially calculated calorie intake which tended to overestimate peasant consumption. Notes: Daily calorie intake is deﬁned as the amount of energy contained in the food and beverages that an adult consumes on a daily basis. According to contemporary Bulgarian studies (Mocheva, 1938: 40), a peasant doing hard agricultural labour requires daily intake of at least 3,400 calories. In most cases, the available sources provided information on the amount of grain consumed in the surveyed households. Based on the information kindly provided by Mariana Kukusheva, Chairwoman of the Bulgarian National Branch Union of Bakers and Pastry Makers, Anketa na nasarchavanata indus- tria (1912: 97, 102) and a series of peasant account books from 1939–41 deposited in the Bulgarian National Archives (fond 505k) and analyzed in Ivanov (2011, 1–2: 121–145), we assume that 1,07 kg of bread are made by one kilo of wheat and 1,54 kg. of bread from one kilo of wheat ﬂour (as well as a 1 : 0.7 wheat to ﬂour ratio). The caloric value of diﬀerent foods and beverages is taken from US Department of Agriculture Calories Database. For country speciﬁc foods (e.g. some types of cheese, varieties of beans, some veg- etables and meat), data on caloric value is from bb-team.org and hranite.info. In line with contemporary estimate of about 10 percent waste of food in peasant households due to luck of refrigeration and feed for domestic animals (Mocheva, 1938: 39), we have reduced rural calorie intake in all years by the cor- responding amount (10 percent). Population and living standards 269 where life in the countryside was “too good” to act as a push factor towards the cities. What did rapid structural change mean for the living standard in the cities? Did living standards rise in tandem with industrialisation, or were there time lags between both processes? This question has generated considerable interest for the case of the Soviet Union, and three stages of the academic debate can be dis- tinguished. The long-held view was one of stagnant, or even declining, living standards (Chapman 1954, 1963; Bergson 1961; Hunter & Szyrmer 1992). While some of the scholars were not unsympathetic to Stalin’s economic approach, they took a view of “no long-term gain without short-term pain”: any living standard increases were reserved for the 1950s and thereafter. In the short term, Stalin’s big push industrialisation achieved the intended structural change but at the expense of a decline in both rural and urban living standards. Rural living standards were squeezed by expropriating farmers and forcing them to deliver food to the cities (both as part of a process known as collectivisation). Urban living standards, for their part, were low, as mass migration to the cities kept wages low and made living conditions precarious. Allen, in two important contributions (Allen 1998, 2003), challenged this view by presenting evidence that suggested mildly rising wages in the urban areas in the 0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50 1898 1905 1911 1921 1923 1925 1927 1929 1931 1933 1935 1937 1939 1941 1943 day labourer mason FIGURE 10.2 Real wages in Bulgarian cities, 1898–1943 Sources: Own calculations based on price and nominal wage data from Bulgarian Statistical Yearbooks (various issues). Notes: In calculating Bulgarian real wages, we follow closely the methodology of estimating a subsist- ence basket as described in Allen and Khaustova (2019: 26–30). In order to adapt the Soviet basket to Bulgarian consumption patterns, we substituted rye bread with wheat bread, lamb with mutton, and potatoes with beans, and use the nutritioal value of these foods from Allen (2001: 421) and Allen and Khaustova (2019: 26–30). 270 Matthias Morys and Martin Ivanov 1930s as well as better nutritional intake. In this view, cities not only oﬀered better living conditions than the countryside; big push industrialisation also meant that a larger share of people was able to take advantage of them. Yet the most recent lit- erature has, in many respects, returned to the older literature. Allen and Khaustova (2019) construct urban real wages for skilled and unskilled workers for the cities of St. Petersburg, Moscow and Kursk for 1853–1937. Their ﬁndings suggest that real wages fell – sometimes by more than 50% – between 1928 and 1937, as the invest- ment needs of big push industrialisation forced a sizeable reduction in consumption (a process also known as “forced savings”). As far as the entire interwar experience is concerned, they ﬁnd that in all six cases they study (skilled and unskilled workers in three cities), real wages were lower in the late 1930s than they had been in 1913. We have constructed real wages in Bulgarian cities in an attempt to put the Russian case in a regional perspective. Following closely the methodology of Allen (2001) and Allen and Khaustova (2019), Figure 10.2 shows real wages – as multi- ples of a standardised subsistence basket – of skilled workers (mason) and unskilled workers (day labourer) for the 1898–1943 period. Comparing Allen and Khausto- va’s (2019) ﬁndings for the cities of Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kursk (ﬁgures 4–6) and our Figure 10.2 suggests three main diﬀerences. First, the standard of living was typically higher in Bulgaria: the welfare ratio was consistently above unity, whereas unskilled workers in Russia and the Soviet Union could often not aﬀord even one subsistence basket of Allen’s uniﬁed approach. Second, Bulgarian wages were far less volatile. The dramatic fall in real wages under Stalin’s ﬁrst two Five-Year Plans (1928–1937) – wages more than halved in some cases – has no equivalent in the Bulgarian case. The rapid changes in the economic regime from war communism (1918–1921) to the New Economic Policy (1921–1928) to big push industrialisa- tion (after 1928) did not allow for a smoother path in the Soviet case. Finally, the trajectories started to diverge in the interwar period. Before World War I, both countries saw wages for skilled and unskilled workers rise. In the interwar period, by contrast, Soviet wages on balance fell whereas Bulgarian wages increased. The Soviet Union forced structural change but made the urban standard of liv- ing worse in the process. In the Bulgarian case, the question poses itself diﬀerently. If urban living standards were moderately comfortable, why did not more people move from the countryside into the towns? We were unable to reconstruct Bulgar- ian rural wages, but nutritional evidence allows a comparison with the countryside. Table  10.10 suggests that Bulgarian peasants were well nourished, and certainly better than their counterparts in the cities. They were small-scale subsistence farmers working their own plots of land, and universal suﬀrage meant that their interests were politically well represented. Bulgarian peasants had little incentive to move during the interwar period. While they were not rich in money terms, their overall condition – nutritional situation, security of property rights and political representation  – did not push them away from the countryside. Neither did the countryside push nor did the cities pull (suﬃciently); consequently, structural change was painfully slow. The simple logic of this approach is vindicated by a compari- son with the post-war period, when the new communist government in Bulgaria Population and living standards 271 imposed collectivisation and forced industrialisation in ways similar to what Stalin had done two decades earlier in the Soviet Union. Food requisitions eroded the posi- tion of the farming population to the point that urban dwellers became better oﬀ. A comparison between the interwar experiences of Bulgaria and the Soviet Union therefore suggests a trade-oﬀ between structural change and living stand- ards. Governments were able to accelerate structural change, but only with a sub- stantial decline of living standards in the short run. Conclusions This chapter has reviewed the demographic experience and the development of living standards in 12 CESEE countries during the interwar period. Due to strong population growth, the Eastern half of the European continent became more pop- ulous than the Western half for the ﬁrst time in European history. The CESEE population grew more strongly, as countries entered the demographic transition later than their Western European counterparts; fertility remained higher but mor- tality had already fallen considerably. The Soviet Union and Bulgaria constituted paradigmatic cases, with annual population growth of 1.5% and more. Not all CESEE countries were in this intermediate phase during the interwar period, and we singled out Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Latvia which essentially followed an earlier Western European path. High population growth put pressure on living standards throughout the region, but governments responded with policies to promote economic growth and improve education and health. Living standards improved in all countries, but the catch-up with Western Europe remained limited when judged by income-centred measures such as GDP per capita. A more positive assessment emerged only when other factors such as longevity and education were taken into account as part of the Historical Index of Human Development (HIHD), an indicator similar to the Human Development Index (HDI) but for historical periods. Judging by the HIHD, a particularly successful country was the Soviet Union. We asked how much credence we should give this ﬁnding in light of the very considerable human losses produced by the famines of 1918–1922 and 1932–1933 and Stalin’s Great Terror of (1936–1938) (a total of 13 million premature deaths in mid-range estimates). Were we dealing here – quite literally – with “survivor bias,” or was there something to the revisionist account by scholars such as Robert Allen? Given the controversies surrounding living standards in the early Soviet Union, we probed deeper and contrasted the Soviet experience with Bulgaria, an equally poor country in 1913 but which underwent its own big push industrialisa- tion only after World War II. The Soviet Union achieved structural change, but living standards improved nowhere near as strongly as revisionists claim. In fact, they almost certainly fell when judged by urban wages and nutritional intake. Life in the countryside was even worse, although reliable statistical evidence to sup- port this view is diﬃcult to muster. Conversely, living standards in the Bulgarian countryside were relatively high, disincentivising the peasants from moving to the 272 Matthias Morys and Martin Ivanov cities. The experience of the two countries suggests that governments can force structural change, but any improvements in living standards will materialise only with a considerable time lag. Note 1 With the exception of Albania, for which Prados de la Escosura (2015) provides values as early as 1913, the year of the country’s independence. We know very little about Albania’s economic and social history in the 20th century, but the available evidence suggests that the country performed consistently worse and oﬀered lower living standards than any other CESEE country.

The state socialist period 1945–1989/1991 Introduction The rise and fall of state socialism dominated the political and economic history of Central, East, and South-East Europe in the second half of the 20th century. The post-war settlement and the East-West tensions that emerged from it divided the continent into two opposing ideological and military blocs. Under Soviet domi- nation, the CESEE countries adopted Soviet-style political institutions and the Stalinist model of economic management. Given their extensive experience with state intervention during the war and the widespread perception that the state had to assume a vital role in post-war reconstruction, all governments in Europe pursued active and development-oriented economic policies. The share of public spending in national income rose to levels never seen before, factor markets were much restricted, strategic industries nationalized, and key resources publicly allo- cated. Thus, state socialism emerged in an international environment that heavily favored a strong public presence in the economy (Eichengreen 2007). However, state socialism went beyond the extent of government intervention that Western societies envisaged or ever put in practice; the socialist state directly commanded economic agents. Marxist ideology was the main source of divergence from the experience of Western market economies, but the relatively much greater extent of destruction and dislocation that the war had caused in Eastern Europe had impor- tant legacies, too (Vonyó 2020). In this chapter, we demonstrate how ideology interacted with economic and geopolitical conditions in shaping the economic institutions and economic policy between the end of the war and the fall of communism. We begin by describing the classical model of the command economy, which was implemented ﬁrst in the Soviet Union by Joseph Stalin (1878–1953) during the 1930s and remained in place until the death of the dictator (section 2). While this takes us outside of our 12 ECONOMIC POLICY UNDER STATE SOCIALISM, 1945\u00001989 Andrei Markevich and Tamás Vonyó 304 Andrei Markevich and Tamás Vonyó time frame, it builds the foundations upon which we can explain the development of central planning after 1945. The Soviet system represented a template that other countries in the region had to adopt as a matter of principle. Thus, it will remain the focal point of our exposition for the post-war period as well. We then describe (section 3) the convergence to the Soviet model in Central and South-East Europe during the late 1940s, followed by a discussion of the signiﬁcant departures from Soviet policy and the classical model of the command economy in the decades that followed (section 4). Finally, we discuss the contribution of economic policy to the collapse of state socialism in the late 1980s, and ask to what extent political factors rather than the intrinsic ineﬃciency of the socialist system determined its fate (section 5). The origins of the command economy: the Stalinist model, 1928–1953 The origins of the command economy in the USSR were closely associated with Stalin’s policy of rapid industrialization and forced collectivization in the late 1920s and during the 1930s (Nove 1992).1 This program required huge invest- ments into industry that would have been diﬃcult to accumulate in a backward economy with inadequate domestic savings and underdeveloped capital markets (Erlich 1960). The collectivization of agriculture allowed the communist regime to eliminate peasant farms as an independent source of economic decision-making (in addition to the already established state ownership of the land, nationalized industries, and the state monopoly over foreign trade) and to ﬁnalize the construc- tion of a vertical hierarchy that governed the entire economy like a single public corporation. The state came to own almost all productive resources other than labour. There were no markets for land or capital, and in particular for any type of machinery that could be legally bought, sold or leased. Central planning provided the tool to mobilize recourses and to shift them from agriculture into industry. Prices were ﬁxed and became an accounting category rather than an economic one; crucially they did not signal the relative scarcity of goods any longer. Central planners assigned plan targets to individual producers and directly allocated the necessary resources to them. Since the output of many state ﬁrms was the input of others, central planners set up plans on the distribution of produced goods estab- lishing who would receive (buy) what and from whom. Legally, buyers could not refuse to implement these plans and not to buy these goods or to buy them from diﬀerent sellers. This led to the domination of the seller rather than the buyer in the counteragent relationship. The seller could extract resources from the buyer, for example by economizing on the quality of the product sold. Money followed the plan expressed in physical units. The nationalized banking system was the only source of credit, and the state provided credit only for the realization of the tasks stipulated in the plan. The plan was the law, and the government could use coercion to enforce its realization (Gregory and Stuart 2001; Gregory and Har- rison 2005). Economic policy under state socialism 305 The speed with which the new policy and the new economic system were introduced was remarkable. It is more diﬃcult to reveal the ﬁnal objectives of these transformations and, more generally, the policy objectives of the command system. Oﬃcial ideology envisaged the building of a communist society, where ‘all human material needs will be satisﬁed’ (Communist Party, 1961). In other words, the rais- ing of living standards was advocated as the ultimate target. However, the allocation of national income by end-use in the Soviet Union under Stalin (as well as under his successors) did not conform to this principle, as the shares of investment and government consumption increased at the cost of household consumption. Living standards remained modest, especially in the rural sector, and dropped signiﬁcantly during the crisis of the early 1930s and the war years after 1940. The theoreti- cal predictions of Preobrazhensky (1926) and Feldman (1928), that rapid capital accumulation at the early stage of industrialization would lead to long-run con- sumption levels higher than what could be achieved with more balanced growth, proved erroneous. As the previous chapter has shown, investment shares across the CESEE region were growing until the 1970s (and in the Soviet Union until the very end of communism), while economic growth was slowing down. This points to investment and growth in heavy industry for its own sake as the likely true goals of the communist regimes (Gregory 2003). Shares of governmental expenditures, in particular on defence, were also high in the communist countries (Kontorovich and Wein 2009). The order of objectives changed over time and varied across countries as a result of both internal politics and changing geopolitical conditions. Communist governments began to part with repression and purchased loyalty after Stalin’s death in 1953 (Pikhoja 2000). This required the reallocation of recourses in favour of consumption and public building projects to maintain the economic legitimacy of communism. Yet the intensiﬁcation of the Cold War worked in the opposite direction. The defence burden proved signiﬁcant, in particular for the Soviet Union, which had to pay a heavy price for maintaining its East European empire and engagement in the nuclear arms race (Chapter 11). Regardless of the objective function of the communist government, the com- mand system had fundamental drawbacks that complicated the implementation of any chosen policy. First, as early critics had already noted (Hayek 1944), planning at the national level required tremendous amounts of information as well as com- putational power to allocate recourses eﬃciently. Even though linear program- ming (ﬁrst developed by Leonid Kantorovich, 1912–1986) and the invention of computers softened these constraints, they remained pressing and arguably even grew over time, as the complexity of the economy increased. Second, economic agents pursued their own interest, which often contradicted the objectives of the central planners (the principle), and behaved opportunistically, creating a princi- ple-agent problem or agency dilemma. The centre needed to employ agents and had to delegate authority to them to run the system, but could not monitor all their actions. To tackle the information problem, the ﬁrst generation of Soviet planners had already developed the so-called material balance method to assure equality between 306 Andrei Markevich and Tamás Vonyó the supply of the main inputs and the intermediate products on the one hand, and their utilization in the economy on the other. The material balance method allevi- ated, but did not eliminate, information asymmetries. It secured a development path balanced across sectors without substantial industry-speciﬁc bottlenecks, but it did not help to choose between various potentially possible resource allocations and select the one that would maximize output. Second, as a result of the lim- ited computational power at their disposal, the planning authorities constructed material balances at relatively high levels of aggregation – sector or sub-sector and regional levels. This practice simply transferred the problem of unbalanced supply and demand for particular intermediate goods to a lower level of decision-making. In practice, as the detailed research on the performance of industrial planning in the USSR shows, the central government tended to use planning as a tool to impose its ‘vision of the future of the economy’ (Zaleski 1980) rather than as a device to coordinate the eﬀorts of the various economic agents. This approach caused planning mistakes and produced shortages of particular inputs. In turn, these problems required corrections of approved plans at a stage when they had already been put into operation. Another issue was that the center, and its chief planning organization, the Gosplan, required information from below to elaborate coherent plans; yet the lower-level agents contacted to provide this local information often had an incentive to manipulate it in an attempt to secure more favorable plan tasks that would be easier to implement. An exchange of information between planners and producers and eﬀective bargaining over future plan targets and resources neces- sary for their implementation contributed to the practice of ex-post changes to the plans as well as to delays in their preparation. In particular, few economic agents started the corresponding planning period with a full-scale plan at hand (Mark- evich 2003). In other words, the communist state possessed complete ownership control over productive assets, but the capacity of the planning system to employ these assets eﬃciently was limited. From this perspective, Zaleski (1980) suggested to treat the Soviet-type economies as command economies rather than planned economies, underlining the priority of management over planning. Insuﬃcient eﬀorts because of weak incentive schemes were another manifesta- tion of opportunistic behaviour by economic agents (Berliner 1957; Belova and Gregory 2002; Gregory and Markevich 2002). From the early years, the central planners faced the problem of ‘success indicators’ to evaluate achievements of indus- trial units (Nove 1958). Plans consisted of many targets (gross output in physical units and roubles, the wage fund, utilization of capital inputs, sales, proﬁts, etc.), the most important of which was gross output. Managers received bonuses if the plan was fulﬁlled in gross terms. Yet as described above, economic agents were heavily involved in the elaboration of plans and could manipulate information to get lower plan targets to begin with. Monitoring was the other main concern. The central planners observed the output produced rather than the eﬀorts applied by economic agents, making it diﬃcult for them to establish whether the agent’s own eﬀorts or external factors (either positive or negative) secured the results. Finally, a dynamic aspect to the principal-agent problem, known as the ‘ratchet eﬀect’, produced Economic policy under state socialism 307 further diﬃculties. Higher achievements in the ﬁrst period resulted in higher plan targets in the next period, demotivating agents to work hard (Weitzman 1980). The command system was constructed as a hierarchical pyramid along the ver- tical lines of production; it suﬀered from the principal-agent problem at all levels of bureaucracy. Many agents were also principals for their subordinates, further complicating the governing procedure. Figure 12.1 illustrates the organization of the governing structure of the command economy as a unitary form hierarchy (U-form), where each division at a lower level specialized in the production of particular types of output. The government at the top (broadly deﬁned, includ- ing its party component) made policy decisions and transmitted them to industrial ministries. The ministries speciﬁed these objectives and transmitted them along hierarchical lines to chief administrations responsible for corresponding sub-sectors of the economy. These departments elaborated detailed plans and communicated them to factories and other production units. Under normal conditions, principals dealt only with their immediate subordinates, delegating authority to them to spec- ify plan targets and orders. This U-form hierarchy facilitated gains from specializa- tion and economies of scale. On the downside, in such hierarchy, achievements of industrial units were poorly comparable with each other, which complicated the task of creating optimal incentives (Maskin et al. 2000; Qian et al. 2006). Did the command economy leave any space for market allocation of goods and recourses mediated by supply and demand rather than through government deci- sions? The answer is ‘yes’ even in the strictest Stalinist model. First, state agents at all levels initiated horizontal quasi-legal or even illegal market exchanges. De jure sales and usage rights of resources belonged to the state, but agents assumed control over these rights in practice (Belova and Gregory 2002; Gregory and Markevich 2002; Markevich and Harrison 2006). Authorities tended to overlook such illegal contracts as long as they mitigated the drawbacks of the command system and contributed to plan fulﬁlment. Second, the labour market, albeit heavily regulated, remained in operation in all command economies throughout the socialist period. FIGURE 12.1 A command-economy hierarchy 308 Andrei Markevich and Tamás Vonyó Individuals had an opportunity to choose where to work and to change their workplaces. 2 Moreover, the right to work guaranteed by the law led to almost no unemployment, which improved the reservation options of labour and accord- ingly its bargaining position (Granik 1987). 3 Third, elements of market allocation remained in the sector of retail trade. Prices were ﬁxed in state trade, but citizens could still make their choice as consumers. Shortages or inventories of particular goods were outcomes of this system if demand did not meet supply. Semi-legal private petty trade and black markets for consumer goods were an important part of the command economy, while the scale of such trade varied over time and space (Grossman 1977; Osokina 2001). In the classical Stalinist model, the political dictatorship was a complement of the command economy. However, this was a suﬃcient but hardly necessary condition of a command economy. Many non-communist democratic coun- tries employed elements of strategic planning and politically driven allocation of resources during the First and Second World Wars (Harrison 1998; Broadberry and Harrison 2005).4 It is the scale of non-market allocation of recourses that makes the experience of command economies unique. Unlimited political power and an opportunity to use coercion brutally provided the means to implement the allocation of recourses and to enforce plan fulﬁlment along the lines of gov- ernment objectives, even if the latter were at odds with consumer preferences. As famously argued by Lange (1958), the command economy was a ‘permanent war economy’. Many authors underline the high level of militarization in the Soviet economy. Military spending rose from 1% to 18% of national income between 1928, the start of Stalin’s ﬁrst Five-Year Plan and 1940 (Davis 1999), and remained high in the post-war period (Chapter 11). The dictator, however, did not maximise defence spending or investments into heavy and defence industry at all costs; the 1930s as well as the post-war years saw striking ﬂuctuations in both types of outlays. There was a clear trade-oﬀ between maximizing investment and the necessity to secure suﬃcient standards of living to avoid social unrest (Gregory 2003). The same can be said about the role of state terror in economic management. While the dicta- tor relied extensively on terror and harsh punishment for political and economic reasons, the imprisonment and liquidation of citizens had both opportunity and direct costs that shaped the implementation of such policy in practice (Belova and Gregory 2009). Post-war reconstruction and Stalinization in Eastern Europe, 1945–1953 The Stalinist model is essential to understand the evolution of economic institu- tions in the broader CESEE region after World War II. As Chapter 11 has out- lined, the economic consequences of the war were much more severe in the east than in the west of Europe. They brought not only physical destruction but also Economic policy under state socialism 309 an immense loss of economically productive manpower and the near total disinte- gration of many economies in the region (for comparative estimates see Harrison 1998). Therefore, state management, rather than mere intervention, was initially an imperative, not an outcome of policy choice. Governments, whether formed by communist parties or by national-unity coalitions, swiftly nationalized large-scale industry, the transport network, the energy sector, and ﬁnancial institutions. Wages and prices remained ﬁxed after the war, and practically all the key consumer prod- ucts as well as industrial inputs were state-rationed. In East Germany and Hungary, military occupation and the reparations regime created further justiﬁcations for state control (Berend 1997). The enormous reconstruction needs also meant that government policy was bound to prioritize the growth of industrial output over technological eﬃciency or the quality of products and services. For example, production in the Hungarian textile industry was restarted after 1946 with outdated British machinery acquired at scrap-metal prices (Berend 2006). To alleviate critical food shortages in urban areas necessitated the direct requisitioning of food by public authorities, especially where markets were still dislocated. Finally, the Holocaust, the expulsion of mil- lions of ethnic Germans and the post-war population exchanges between countries (especially of ethnic Poles and Ukrainians between Poland and the Soviet Union) left a plethora of private assets without owners and often the skills necessary to operate them. Thus, there were often no practical alternatives for the state owner- ship of the means of production. Ownership structures were further shaken up by popular land reforms, which, in most countries, only gave de jure recognition for what had already been de facto established by the rural communities. A power- ful swing in economic policies towards the left was bound to happen even with- out Soviet intervention and shake Eastern European societies to their foundations. Public legitimization for state control over the commanding heights of the econ- omy was widespread for the redistribution of private wealth, for the administrative setting of wages and prices, and even for the rationing of scarce commodities and living space. Public support for a transition to a totalitarian political regime and subjuga- tion to Soviet dominance was much weaker. The Stalinist state and terror faced signiﬁcant resistance everywhere and was impossible to achieve without Soviet intervention in the form of direct support to local communist parties, the liquida- tion of opposition ﬁgures and the manipulation of elections. Soviet intervention did come, and it pushed authoritarian controls and state management of the econ- omy throughout the CESEE region close to the Soviet model. The ﬁnal break- ing point came in 1947, when the by then predominantly left-wing governments rejected Marshall Plan aid at the Kremlin’s insistence. The following years wit- nessed communist takeovers, the Berlin Blockade (1948/1949), and the division of Germany (1949). In response to the European Recovery Program (Marshall Plan) and the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Soviet Union created the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) 310 Andrei Markevich and Tamás Vonyó in 1949 that called explicitly for the Sovietization of Eastern European economies and eventually developed into a military bloc known as the Warsaw Pact (1955). Sovietization introduced the Stalinist command economy in all CESEE coun- tries, 5 in conjunction with the establishment of totalitarian governance. Coalition governments in Czechoslovakia and Hungary were dissolved and dissidents within communist parties, such as Władisław Gomulka (1905–1982) in Poland or Lucre- tiu Patrascanu (1900–1954) in Romania, were eliminated and replaced by Stalin loyalists. Most industrial ﬁrms were nationalized by the early 1950s, and the col- lectivization of agriculture (with the exception of Poland) was gradually completed until the early 1960s. Following the classical model, governments employed central planning to promote industrialization and the structural transformation of the pre- dominately agrarian economies, largely in favour of heavy industry and defence ﬁrms (Berend 2006). Initial economic conditions aﬀected the scale of such trans- formations. There was more room for the shift away from agriculture to industry in less developed Bulgaria or Romania than in economically more advanced Czecho- slovakia or East Germany. There was greater urgency in developing new capacity in capital goods in countries that until 1945 had relied on German imports then in countries like Czechoslovakia, which had developed their own heavy industry earlier. In the Soviet Union itself, Stalin’s government maintained its policy course established in the 1930s, now with a view towards accumulating the recourses nec- essary for rapid reconstruction and recovery. There was little variation among the command economies of the region in the Stalinist era. The evolution of the socialist economic system conformed to the Soviet model even in Yugoslavia until the early 1950s. Despite the rift between Josip Tito (1892–1980) and Stalin in 1947 and 1948, the Yugoslav government adopted rigid central planning, stressing heavy industrialization along the classical Soviet model. Most private assets were expropriated, industrialization was pur- sued through forced savings extracted from agriculture and from consumers, while the heavy hand of the government channelled capital to the manufacturing sector through budget transfers (Lampe 2000). By 1951, a quarter of private land hold- ings had been forcefully collectivized, leading to violent clashes with the peasantry and the collapse of farm output (Woodward 1995). Although Yugoslavia eventually became known for its unique model of market socialism, the economic system of all CESEE countries initially converged towards the same unitary model. Kornai (1980, 1992) famously described this unitary economic model of social- ism. His work has inﬂuenced many scholarly interpretations of the command economy. Kornai deﬁned linkages between the fundamental building blocks of the socialist system. The single-party dictatorship enforced public property over the means of production, which, once nationalized, were managed by bureau- cratic coordination. The central bureaucracy consolidated the political system and created the conditions for central planning, making market incentives redundant. State enterprises operated under so-called soft budget constraints, meaning that the central government covered their losses in the case of poor plan fulﬁlment. The command economy was marked by forced growth, the simultaneous existence of Economic policy under state socialism 311 shortages and waste, and a limited role for international trade. In turn, the ‘shortage economy’ further increased the dependence on state coordination, which further consolidated the political system and the power of the communist party. Kornai’s description of the socialist economic system in the post-war era is fully consistent with the classical Stalinist model. After Stalin: reforming the command economy, 1953–1974 Stalin’s death in 1953 triggered important changes in all socialist countries in East- ern Europe. The new Soviet government under Nikita Khrushchev (1894–1971) took a lead in de-Stalinization that aﬀected all policy aspects across the communist bloc, including substantial changes in the allocation of resources and the manage- ment of economic relations. Sectors producing consumer goods and services were given higher priority in order to lift living standards. The ‘virgin land’ campaign pursued under Khrushchev aimed at extending arable land and increasing grain production. Massive programs of social housing construction and other initiatives directly targeted the improvement of urban welfare. In sharp contrast to the Stalin- ist era, per capita consumption in the Soviet Union rose signiﬁcantly and increased by almost half between 1953 and 1964 (Schroeder and Denton 1982). Similar shifts away from heavy industry as the main priority occurred in other communist countries. Agricultural investments in Hungary and in South-East Europe nearly doubled in the mid-1950s, supported by a temporary halt in collectivization. Simultaneously, the socialist governments began to rely more on economic incen- tives rather than direct regulation and coercive enforcement (Berend 1997). The Soviet government dismantled the infamous gulag system of forced labour camps, gradually releasing approximately half of its prisoners and completely reorganizing the system of penal labour (Elie 2013). Terror, which had been an inalienable part of the Stalinist dictatorship, became less characteristic of state socialism. De-Stalinization was driven from above. Based on detailed archival documents describing Stalin’s inner circle in the early post-war era, Gorlizki and Khlevniuk (2005) argue that the main defects of the Stalinist model and the need for change were well recognized by almost all of Stalin’s closest subordinates; they simply feared to take the initiative as long as the dictator was alive. The supply of reforms from above ﬁtted the demand from below very well. In most countries of the region, the immediate social consequences of Stalinization had been catastrophic. Living standards had dropped alarmingly, fuelling popular unrest, and the authori- tarian regimes had been able to maintain social order only by instilling the fear of repressions. Once Stalin died, a more open articulation of political and economic demands became possible, as evidenced by the ﬁrst uprising against communist rule and Soviet domination in East Germany in June 1953 and subsequently the general strike and full-blown revolution in Hungary in 1956. The ‘new course’ towards reforms was a trial-and-error process heavily aﬀected by the Soviet political economy and the power struggle among Stalin’s successors. 312 Andrei Markevich and Tamás Vonyó The Sovnarkhoz reform initiated in 1957 oﬀers an illustrative example. The reform shifted the balance of power away from industrial oﬃcials in the central apparatus in Moscow towards local party elites in the regions; in this way, it contributed to the victory of Khrushchev as the new party leader over his political rivals more committed to continue Stalin’s policy and linked more closely to the industry ministries. The reform reshuﬄed the Soviet bureaucracy and replaced the U-form hierarchy with a multi-divisions hierarchy (M-form), where each region stood for a single division. Regions (and regional party secretaries) rather than industry min- istries (and corresponding central authorities) became responsible for economic outcomes. The new hierarchy made the achievements of its divisions directly com- parable with each other: parallels in the industrial structure of the regions were clearer to detect than between the highly specialized industrial branch ministries. This allowed the centre to organize a yardstick competition among regional leaders, linking career promotions to relative performance as powerful incentives. How- ever, Soviet regional divisions remained highly inter-related economically, creating incentives for regional leaders to pursue policies aimed at undermining industrial growth in neighbouring regions in order to make their own regions look better (Markevich and Zhuravskaya 2011). After eight years in operation, the reform was eventually abandoned (closely linked to Khrushchev’s dismissal in 1964), and the new Brezhnev government restored the traditional Soviet U-form hierarchy. De-Stalinization revived earlier debates going back to the 1920s on planning, prices, and the role of incentives in the socialist economy (e.g. von Mises 1920 [1990], 1922 [1932]; Hayek 1944). The discussion on optimal planning in the late 1950s and 1960s highlighted the concept of ‘opportunity costs’ and focused on how prices should be set in a command economy. Soviet economists, often com- ing from a mathematical background (e.g. Leonid Kontorovich, the only Soviet winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics), recognized that a benevolent planner should know how diﬀerent goods would be valued on the demand side in order to be able to maximize total output. In other words, the eﬃcient allocation of recourses requires prices reﬂecting the relative scarcity of goods and resources. Yet such insight conﬂicted with both the Marxist theory of labour value (which argued for labour driven prices in contrast to prices deﬁned by supply and demand) and the prevalent practices of planning that paid more consideration to the consistency of plans (with the use of material balances) than to eﬃcient resource allocation. As a consequence, optimal planning methods elaborated by theorists were rarely put into practice. Nevertheless, they drew attention to another weak point of planning in the command economy, namely the information problem and the insuﬃcient computational power of the centre to construct an optimal plan. The recogni- tion of this problem initiated a debate on the extent to which decision-making should be delegated to economic agents at lower levels of the hierarchy in order for economic incentives to work better. The speed and degree of these institutional changes varied substantially across the CESEE countries. The ambitious reforms introduced across the region in the late 1960s were inspired by the Soviet decentralization reform launched in 1965 by Alexei Kosygin Economic policy under state socialism 313 (1904–1980), prime minister under Leonid Brezhnev (1906–1982), the new gen- eral secretary. The Kosygin reform provided substantial autonomy to the managers of state enterprises. The number of plan indicators, which the centre delivered to economic agents, was reduced from about 30 to only 8, with a special focus on sales rather than gross output. ‘Production development funds’ comprising a share of proﬁts were set up at the enterprise level. Firms could use these funds on their own, including for the purpose of capital investments. Simultaneously, the central government revised prices in order to allow the average enterprise to generate a proﬁt under ‘normal conditions’ (prices subsequently remained ﬁxed at the new level). As a result of the reform, proﬁts were channelled into the incentive funds of the enterprises, strengthening the role of bonuses as incentives for managers (Kontorovich 1988). These measures, however, did not achieve their main objective, namely faster growth and structural development. The Kosygin reform did not alter the basic features of the command economy: it transformed but did not replace the funda- mental components of the system. Sales as a new main plan target made no real eﬀect on eﬃciency as long as the economy continued to operate as a sellers’ mar- ket. The introduction of market relationship between state ﬁrms when they could buy and sell to each other following demand and supply rather than state plans, called the wholesale market for state ﬁrms, was under discussion but never real- ized. The role of proﬁts as an incentive was also limited under the Soviet realities. Enterprises remained in public ownership, and the state was still supposed to cover their potential losses, thereby maintaining soft budget constraints. Incentives for the implementation of risky projects and the overuse of recourses remained powerful, while the incentives to innovate remained weak (Kornai 1992). In addition, the law prohibited the accumulation of reserves, and the use of the ‘enterprise develop- ment fund’ was strictly regulated. When the focus shifted to proﬁts, this contrib- uted to inﬂation: managers received incentives to produce more expensive items, as they secured higher returns. The reform faced substantial opposition from within the industrial bureaucracy, especially at the higher levels, as the decentralization of resource allocation contradicted the basic concept of central planning. Therefore, oﬃcials in the industrial ministries sabotaged and delayed the implementation of the reforms as much as they could (Schroeder 1973). Governments in Central Europe began to discuss far-reaching reform propos- als in the early 1960s and launched reform programs far more ambitious than the Kosygin plan, beginning with East Germany in 1965, followed by Czechoslovakia in 1967, Hungary in 1968, and Poland in the early 1970s. Quasi-market prices were reintroduced in several sectors, managers of state enterprises were expected to maximize proﬁts rather than (or besides) output targets, and they were given substantial autonomy in allocating resources, investment funds, and labour. By the late 1960s, approximately half of all investments were ﬁnanced from enterprise proﬁts and thus were allocated in a de-centralized manner, in contradiction to the classical model of the command economy. Yet while far-reaching on some level, all these reforms failed to change the development trend, as the ﬁgures reported in 314 Andrei Markevich and Tamás Vonyó Chapter 11 suggest. But economic liberalization and decentralization of economic decision-making did contribute to the growing demand for political change, most vividly in Czechoslovakia, culminating in the Prague Spring of 1968, the greatest uprising against Soviet domination in Eastern Europe since Hungary’s supressed revolution of 1956. The Prague Spring convinced conservatives both in the USSR and other socialist countries to limit, or even terminate, reforms of the command economy (Berend 2006). Only Hungary and Yugoslavia continued to embark on reforms. The introduc- tion of the New Economic Mechanism in Hungary in 1968 was supported by a strong political consensus within the communist party and followed earlier policies of relaxing authoritarian controls; policies which were designed to heal the wounds of Hungarian society after the brutal repression of the 1956 revolution and forced collectivization until 1961. While the reforms slowed down in the early 1970s, they were never rolled back completely, and even received new impetus in the early 1980s. Most raw material and energy prices remained ﬁxed, but the majority of prices for ﬁnished goods ﬂuctuated. The system of plan targets was abolished and replaced by incentives for enterprises, which came to have substantial autonomy in deciding what and how much to produce. Managers of state enterprises were expected to maximize proﬁts, which were an increasingly important source of both investments and wages (for further details see Kornai 1986). From the early 1950s, Yugoslavia began to embark on building a unique version of socialism that for many developing countries represented a ‘third-way’ alterna- tive to the Western capitalist and the Soviet communist models. Collectivization and binding output targets were abandoned, and most decision-making power was delegated to state enterprises (Prout 1985). Firms became eﬀectively labour-man- aged, organized along the principles of self-management. Work councils, designed to represent the interests of workers, could, in conjunction with the local govern- ment, hire and ﬁre the managers of the enterprise and take many decisions on marketing and production. Such a system was meant to provide better incentives for labour and to make better use of local information, mitigating two fundamental problems of the command economy. While the means of production remained in state property, workers claimed eﬀectively rights over the income derived from these assets. The federally controlled General Investment Fund was the only pow- erful tool left in the hands of the central government to steer economic develop- ment. The economic reforms of 1965 went further down this road towards ‘market socialism’. Besides the liberalization of most prices, enterprises were granted greater autonomy in the distribution of proﬁts between wages and investment. They were also allowed to directly engage in foreign trade and even to establish banks, in cooperation with local governments, to manage their investments and trade transactions. Even though Yugoslavia did not yield to Soviet pressure, local conservatives in the communist party and the central bureaucracy became wary of the increased powers of local political leaders and enterprise managements. The constitutional reform of 1974 was a backlash against decentralization and created an Economic policy under state socialism 315 overregulated economy of overlapping institutions that undermined the eﬃciency of investment decisions (Uvalić 1992). The 1974 Yugoslav constitution has often been blamed for the breakup of the country in the 1990s, partly because it granted the six constituent republics a right to self-determination – a stipulation which became politically important after the death of Tito in 1980. With its 406 articles, it was the longest constitution in the world and also one of the most complex ones. It created an excessive bureaucracy that undermined central control in economic management, but at the same time repressed local and ﬁrm-level initiatives by delegating powers to much-strength- ened administrations and assemblies in the constituent republics (Rich 1993). It is diﬃcult to establish whether reforms towards a diﬀerent version of social- ism had any positive eﬀects on economic growth. We do not observe any major shift in the macro trends discussed in the previous chapter between the pre- and post-reform periods. Rates of productivity growth or the direction of structural development in the most reform-oriented countries did not diﬀer fundamentally from the rest of the CESEE region, even though services seem to have become slightly more important for economic growth in Hungary and Yugoslavia from the 1970s onwards than they were elsewhere. The reforms may have had important secondary eﬀects by allowing for a more open discussion: raising public awareness for the most pressing challenges of state socialism may have prepared these socie- ties better for the later transition to the market economy, but this proposition must remain speculative. Bulgaria and Romania remained largely isolated from the reform movement within the Soviet bloc. Until the 1970s, the classical command economy delivered industrialization and generated high rates of economic growth, as Chapter 11 has demonstrated. Economic growth was sustainable only at sharply rising rates of investment, but it did lead to an unprecedented increase in living standards and public service provisions. Amidst the crisis of the 1980s, there may have been popular demand for reforms, but austerity in both countries was carried through with brute political repression, thwarting any initiative pressing for change. Not surprisingly, the downfall of communism and the severity of the shock that fol- lowed was more dramatic in Bulgaria and Romania than in other countries within the broader region. Why did socialism fail? The role of economic policy, 1975–1989 Economic development in socialist countries was slowing down for at least a decade before the demise of communism in the late 1980s. However, very few contem- porary observers foresaw the downfall of the communist regimes even a few years before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. This is true even though economists and policymakers were well aware of the defects and the fundamental ineﬃciencies of the command economy. The ex-post discussion on the reasons of this unexpected 316 Andrei Markevich and Tamás Vonyó failure revolves around quite diﬀerent types of explanations, in addition to the role of exogenous shocks highlighted in Chapter 11. The interpretations advanced in this context either stress the intrinsic drawbacks of the command economy; or, alternatively, they hold speciﬁc policy mistakes and related political factors for responsible. One fact should be acknowledged: the fundamental problems of the command economy cannot explain the rapid and sudden collapse of socialism, and thus the role of politics and exogenous factors cannot easily be ignored. Berliner (2001) oﬀers an analogy to racing: whom should we blame, the horse (the com- mand system), the jockey (the policymakers who operated it), or maybe the race- track (the international environment) that was changed in the middle of the derby? Some advocated that multiple mistakes in policymaking led to the ineﬃcient allocation of recourses or even their complete loss. Allen (2003) reconsidered the fall of the Soviet economy and the gradual demise of productivity in the post-war period from this perspective. Massive investments into the Asian regions of the USSR with harsh climate represent one example of such decisions. Mikhailova (2004) estimated that economic activities in the Soviet Union were skewed to the East compared to what would have happened under market conditions (using Canada as the benchmark); at least 14 million people or 35% of the population in these regions would not have settled there, if it had not been for speciﬁc Soviet government policies. In a similar way, the state increased investments in collectiv- ized agriculture despite poor returns (Hanson 2003). The growing complexity of national economies increased the probability of planning mistakes to occur (Banerjee and Spagat 1991). After the oil shocks, the Soviet government got extra resources to cover potential losses from such mistakes that made them politically more aﬀordable. Oil prices increased more than four times over the 1970s and then more than doubled again in the early 1980s. The Soviet Union, being one of the leading exporters of hydrocarbons in the world, exploited its newly gained comparative advantage. Soaring oil exports increased annual Soviet net revenue from foreign trade more than ﬁve times during the 1970s that eliminated incentives to reform. Extra oil revenues allowed the Soviet govern- ment to let consumption to grow faster than output and to prolong public support for the regime for some time without any major changes in the system (Gaidar 2007). However, as explained in Chapter  11, the oil shocks had the diametri- cally opposite impact on the oil-importing CESEE countries: drastically increased import bills, dramatically worsened credit positions, and severe austerity, especially compared to the reckless overspending in the 1970s. This made these countries more rather than less vulnerable to potential planning mistakes. For the critics of the command economy, like von Mises (1922) and Hayek (1944), mass-scale planning mistakes were inevitable at some point. The lack of market prices reﬂecting relative scarcities in goods and resources made planners unable to process the vast amount of information needed for eﬃcient allocation. Yet the idea that poor investments and policy mistakes from the 1970s onwards caused the collapse of the entire system is problematic on the grounds of timing. Similar planning mistakes in earlier periods did not have substantial consequences. Economic policy under state socialism 317 In particular, huge investment projects in the late Stalinist era, the so-called great constructions of communism (including the railway beyond the polar circle, or a tunnel to Sakhalin Island), were abandoned immediately after the death of the dictator, with huge losses of investments already undertaken. The ﬁrst attempt to construct the Danube-Black Sea channel in Romania shared the same fate. Like- wise, the substantial drop in grain prices associated with the 1930s Great Depres- sion did not bring the Soviet system down, even though millions of Soviet citizens experienced famine and died as a result. The three examples motivate an explanation that points to the changing role of coercion and violence in the system. Harrison (2002) suggests that gradual learn- ing of the non-credibility of the threat of punishment undermined the eﬀective- ness of authoritarian control. Once workers realized that the threat of punishment was no longer credible, they switched to the strategy of strikes to defend their rights, eventually bringing the system to its knees. The opposition trade union Solidarity movement in Poland in the 1980s represents the canonical example for this dynamic. Although the Polish regime under Wojciech Jaruzelski (1923–2014) justiﬁed the return to a more repressive style of government by the threat of Soviet intervention if protests were left unchecked, Polish society no longer believed that the events of Budapest in 1956 and Prague in 1968 would be repeated. Simi- larly, non-credible punishment strategies stimulated collusion and opportunistic behaviour among economic agents against the central government, undermining incentive structures for managers and increasing the share of ‘bad’ projects in the investment pool (Murrell and Olson 1991; Shleifer and Vishny 1992). The ques- tion why communist governments did not move back to the policy of intensive coercion and punishment highlights the role of politics. The elites themselves were not ready to pay this price because repression could aﬀect them, too. For example, in the USSR, the political loyalty of the Soviet elite was achieved by the Brezhnev policy of the ‘irremovability of cadres’ that became remarkably visible starting in the 1970s, when ageing Soviet leaders rarely if ever retired. Soviet stagnation under- mined the legitimacy and attractiveness of the communist movement globally. An alternative political-economy explanation stresses the crowding diﬃculties driven by the fundamentals of the command system. Kim (1999, 2002) docu- mented hoarding and thus shortages of consumer goods because of illegal purchases of state enterprises in the state retail sector. He argues that these growing shortages triggered the collapse of communism. Under normal conditions in the command economy, the planners did not allow state ﬁrms to purchase in the state retail trade; only citizens could buy there. This allowed the planners to separate the consumer market and the economy of state enterprises, and to plan them eﬃciently. Grow- ing violations of the ban led to the siphoning of ﬁnancial recourses, which the central planners initially allocated to state enterprises, to the consumer market and produced an unintended increase in demand for goods in the state retail trade. This unexpected demand was not supported by supply, which because of ﬁxed prices led to shortages. The growing shortages eventually invoked social unrest (Ellman and Kontorovich 1992). The central authorities had incentives to overlook the 318 Andrei Markevich and Tamás Vonyó problem because these practices of siphoning gave additional material resources to state ﬁrms that increased their chances to fulﬁl production plans (Harrison and Kim 2006). Finally, geopolitics and a heavy defence burden in the USSR have featured prominently in the literature on the demise of the Soviet economy. The political objective of the Soviet leadership to maintain strategic parity with the United States pushed the relative size of defence and defence-related expenditure into dangerous territory. The literature agrees that Soviet military expenditure was very large by international standards, and that the defence sector diverted scarce resources that might have been used more eﬃciently in the civilian sector. However, as it was discussed in Chapter 11, it is very diﬃcult to make an accurate prediction about the size and the precise impact of the Soviet defence burden (Firth and Noren 1998; Davis 2002). The other main weakness of interpretations stressing the role of the defence burden in the falling behind of socialist economies is that they ﬁnd little support in the quantitative evidence for the Central and Southeast Europe. All available estimates suggest that the relative size of military spending in the smaller Warsaw Pact countries was comparable to most NATO member states from the 1960s to the 1980s, and never amounted to more than 4% of GDP (Alton et al. 1985; Clements 1985; Crane 1988). While the debate over the causes of the collapse of communism is inconclusive, the literature agrees that the policy of perestroika (literally restructuring) initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev (born 1931) in 1987 contributed to rather than mitigated the crisis (Hanson 2003). After Gorbachev rose to power in 1985, the Soviet gov- ernment ﬁrst followed the old strategy to stimulate economic growth by increasing investments into the machine-building sector in order to expand and modernize the existing capital stock. CIA (1990) estimates conﬁrm that the share of invest- ment in new machinery in GDP peaked during the mid-1980s. Yet this provided only a temporary eﬀect. Under rising popular pressure to increase consumption and public welfare spending, the leadership concluded that the growth potential of the classical model had been exhausted. In search for a new solution, Gorbachev ventured to more radical measures, delegating considerable authority to state enter- prises, with the aim of developing a market of socialist industries. Managers were supposed to be elected by workers and received the right to determine the input- output mix, to contract with suppliers and customers, and to shape the structure of wages and bonus payments within the constraints of state procurement contracts. In practice, the reforms generated the outcomes they were supposed to avoid. The new rules for managers provided incentives to accumulate inventories and to barter rather than sell products at oﬃcial prices, which remained ﬁxed and rarely reﬂected true factor costs. This made transaction costs prohibitively high and eventually depressed productivity and economic output. Simultaneously, the accountability of managers to workers pushed wages up and undermined labour discipline, decreas- ing productivity further. The government’s inability to eliminate the soft budget constraints for the state enterprises implied further subsidies to cover the losses caused by the ill-advised reforms. Finally, monetary expansion (the money supply Economic policy under state socialism 319 grew by 14% annually between 1989 and 1991), which the government viewed as the minor evil, aggravated the existing shortages of consumer goods and ruined the system (Ellman and Kontorovich 1992). Perestroika and glasnost (the principle of open discussion) aﬀected not only the economies of the communist countries in Eastern Europe but also invoked radi- cal changes in their political systems. Launched as a partial and limited liberaliza- tion of the Soviet regime in 1987, Gorbachev’s reforms rapidly went beyond the initial plans both because of popular demand and growing economic diﬃculties. Communist governments gradually lost control over the institutions and peoples they were supposed to govern, including the control over the economy, which reinforced the economic crisis. The collapse of the communist regimes in the Soviet satellite states in 1989 and the dismemberment of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought an end to the socialist experiment. Conclusion The post-war period saw the rise and fall of communism and the command economy in Eastern Europe. CESEE governments nationalized most sectors of economic activity and replaced the market allocation of resources with bureau- cratic coordination. The high level of state control over the economy deﬁned a prominent role of economic policy and politics in the command system. Firms and citizens in communist countries depended on government decisions to a much larger extent than in the conventional market economy. The manual con- trol of the government over the economy implied that the activities of numerous economic agents had to be coordinated in the absence of eﬀective price sig- nals. While communist governments had unlimited authority to implement tight regulations in practice and were in the position to choose any policy irrespective of individual preferences, this did not suﬃce to overcome the main drawbacks of the command system and prevent its collapse. The history of economic policy under state socialism is also a reminder about the eﬀective limits of state interven- tion in the economy. Notes 1 The Bolsheviks’ policy of ‘war communism’ during the Russian Civil War (1917–1922) constitutes a predecessor of the Soviet command economy, but it was rapidly replaced by the mixed economy of the 1920s. Some elements of the command system might be traced back to the experience of extensive state regulation in various European countries, and in particular in Germany, during the First World War (Harrison 2017). 2 Changing the workplace was diﬃcult but possible even during the war years (cf. Sokolov (2003) for a review of Soviet economic labour policy from the late 1930s to the early 1950s). There was little choice if a person was imprisoned, but forced labour constituted only a relatively small share of the Soviet labour force (about 2.5 million people at its peak or up to 3% of the total labour force; cf. Gregory and Lazarev 2003). 3 To mitigate this problem, the state criminalized labour relations and used forced labour as a ‘worker discipline device’ (Miller and Smith 2015). 320 Andrei Markevich and Tamás Vonyó 4 This could happen without de jure re-distribution of property rights in favour of the state (i.e. the state property is not a necessary condition of a command economy). 5 With the exception of Greece, which remained aligned with the West following the Greek Civil War 1946–1949.
