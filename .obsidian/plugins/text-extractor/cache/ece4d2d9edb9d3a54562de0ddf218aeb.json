• Can the public be expected to be as good at forecasting as economists who have much more technical knowledge? • Alternatively, the public doesn’t need to do the forecasting themselves, but can read the predictions of the professionals. • Neither the AEH nor the REH are fully satisfactory. • Economists mostly use REH, especially when they are trying to make policy recommendations. • However, when we are trying to understand the effects of past historical events, which are not part of a regularly repeated pattern, it is implausible to assume agents had RE. 12 Alternatives to AE and RE • Alternatives to the assumptions of the AEH or REH involve modelling the public as learning about their environment. • Such models are technically difficult to work with. • In addition, they do not have a commonly accepted, standard version. • Hence, they have not so far found wide acceptance within macroeconomics. 13 The Policy Ineffectiveness Proposition (PIP) • The policy-ineffectiveness proposition (PIP) is a theory proposed in 1975 by the New Classical School based upon the theory of rational expectations. • It advocates that monetary policy cannot systematically change the levels of output and employment in an economy. 14 The Policy Ineffectiveness Proposition (PIP) To demonstrate if PIP holds, let’s consider the following macroeconomic model (following Hoover, The New Classical Macroeconomics, Ch. 4 pp. 65-73): 𝑦𝑡 = 𝑦𝑛 + 𝛼[𝑝𝑡 − 𝐸𝑡−1(𝑝𝑡)] + 𝜀𝑡 AS function 𝑝𝑡 = 𝑚𝑡 − 𝑦𝑡 + 𝑢𝑡 AD function 𝑚𝑡 = 𝜆 + 𝑚𝑡−1 + 𝑒𝑡 monetary policy rule where 𝐸𝑡−1(𝜀𝑡) = 𝐸𝑡−1(𝑢𝑡) = 𝐸𝑡−1(𝑒𝑡) = 0 and (𝜀𝑡, 𝑢𝑡, 𝑒𝑡) are “white noise”. The question: Can monetary policy be used to affect the mean or the variance of output? 15 The Policy Ineffectiveness Proposition (PIP) 1. Solving for the mean of output, 𝐸𝑡−1(𝑦𝑡): • Take expectations as of period t-1 through the AS function, 𝑦𝑡 = 𝑦𝑛 + 𝛼[𝑝𝑡 − 𝐸𝑡−1(𝑝𝑡)] + 𝜀𝑡: 𝐸𝑡−1(𝑦𝑡) = 𝑦𝑛 + 𝛼 𝐸𝑡−1 𝑝𝑡 − 𝐸𝑡−1 𝐸𝑡−1 𝑝𝑡 + 𝐸𝑡−1( 𝜀𝑡) = 𝑦𝑛 • As 𝐸𝑡−1(𝑦𝑡) = 𝑦𝑛, this implies monetary policy cannot affect the mean of output under REs. 16 The Policy Ineffectiveness Proposition (PIP) 2. Solving for the complete distribution of output, 𝑦𝑡: • Substitute the monetary policy rule, 𝑚𝑡 = 𝜆 + 𝑚𝑡−1 + 𝑒𝑡 into the AD function, 𝑝𝑡 = 𝑚𝑡 − 𝑦𝑡 + 𝑢𝑡: 𝑝𝑡 = [𝜆 + 𝑚𝑡−1 + 𝑒𝑡] − 𝑦𝑡 + 𝑢𝑡 • Take expectations as of period t-1 through this: 𝐸𝑡−1(𝑝𝑡) = 𝜆 + 𝑚𝑡−1 − 𝑦𝑛 • Subtract 𝐸𝑡−1(𝑝𝑡) from the previous equation for 𝑝𝑡 : 𝑝𝑡 − 𝐸𝑡−1(𝑝𝑡) = 𝑦𝑛 − 𝑦𝑡 + 𝑒𝑡 + 𝑢𝑡 • Now substitute the equation for 𝑝𝑡 − 𝐸𝑡−1(𝑝𝑡) back into the AS function, 𝑦𝑡 = 𝑦𝑛 + 𝛼[𝑝𝑡 − 𝐸𝑡−1(𝑝𝑡)] + 𝜀𝑡: 𝑦𝑡 = 𝑦𝑛 + 𝛼 𝑦𝑛 − 𝑦𝑡 + 𝑒𝑡 + 𝑢𝑡 + 𝜀𝑡 17 The Policy Ineffectiveness Proposition (PIP) • Gathering terms in 𝑦𝑡 and re-arranging then gives: 𝑦𝑡 = 𝑦𝑛 + 1 (1+𝛼) [𝛼(𝑒𝑡 + 𝑢𝑡) + 𝜀𝑡] • The second right hand side of the term gives us the random component of output. • We can observe that the policy parameter, 𝜆 from 𝑚𝑡 = 𝜆 + 𝑚𝑡−1 + 𝑒𝑡 does not affect this random component. • This implies 𝜆 does not affect the variance of output and hence, monetary policy cannot be used to stabilise output. 18 The Policy Ineffectiveness Proposition (PIP) • What is the intuition behind this algebraic result? • Remember, deviations of output from its natural level occur because of expectational errors: when actual prices are higher or lower than expected prices. • If people have REs, they use their knowledge of the monetary policy rule to form their expectations of future prices. • Hence, no matter what rate of growth of the money supply the policy-maker chooses, they cannot trick economic agents into systematically misforecasting prices, unlike the case with AEs. • I.e., since there are no systematic expectational errors, there is no systematic effect on output. 19 The Policy Ineffectiveness Proposition (PIP) • The New Classical School’s policy ineffectiveness proposition can be considered to be an extreme version of Monetarism. • Friedman believed monetary policy couldn’t affect real variables in the long-run but accepted that it could affect them in the short-run. • The New Classicals argue that monetary policy is ineffective even in the short-run. 20 The Policy Ineffectiveness Proposition (PIP) • The only way for monetary policy to affect real variables in the short run would be if policy- makers deliberately randomised policy, so that the error term, 𝑒𝑡 in the monetary policy rule would have a larger variance. • Using the solution 𝑦𝑡 = 𝑦𝑛 + 1 (1+𝛼) [𝛼(𝑒𝑡 + 𝑢𝑡) + 𝜀𝑡], we can see that this would imply a larger variance of output too. • However, this is not of much use to policy-makers, since policy-makers would not want to deliberately use monetary policy randomly. 21 The Policy Ineffectiveness Proposition (PIP) • Implications: • Theoretically, PIP represents a significant challenge to the prevailing Keynesianism of the 1970s, as Keynesians argued aggregate demand management can be effective in stabilising the economy. • Practically, if the New Classical view was correct, it implies that inflation can be reduced without even a temporary cost of higher unemployment and recession. • This view influenced the disinflationary policies associated with Ronald Reagan in the US and Margaret Thatcher in the UK in 1980s.
