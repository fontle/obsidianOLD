Introduction 3 Introduction • Politicians are democratically accountable, but: – democracy in general doesn’t guarantee optimal outcomes; – maybe incompetent; – maybe susceptible to inflation bias; – maybe susceptible to electorally induced volatility. Inflation Bias 4 The Barro-Gordon model The Barro-Gordon (1983) model of inflation bias Consider the following very simple set-up where the government's preferences are represented by LG= λπ²+(x-x*)2 LG = the welfare loss to the government, π=inflation, x=output deviation from the natural rate, x*=targeted output and λ is the government's relative dislike for the deviation of inflation from zero. 5 Barro-Gordon: the ‘loss function’ Inflation, π output gap, xx*.0 Losses increase the further away from the 0, x* combination – the ‘bliss point’ Inflation Bias 6 The Barro-Gordon model The ‘constraint’ is the Phillips Curve: which implies x=α(π-πe) where πe is expected inflation. (Note when expectations are correct, output equals its natural rate.) Note this is a rewritten form of the Phillips Curve you encountered in Macro 1 (where inflation was on the LHS). 7 The Barro-Gordon model Inflation, π output gap, xx*.0 Phillips Curve Inflation Bias 8 The Barro-Gordon Model Timing – implicit in the Phillips Curve: (Important!) Wages are set before policy is set. So have to form an expectation of what the policymaker – who here effectively chooses π – will do. Inflation Bias 9 Equilibrium inflation and output Optimization under ‘monetary policy discrection’ (D) implies; L D = λπ² + (x-x*) 2 = λπ² + (α(π-πe)-x *)2 ∂ L D /∂π= 2λπ + 2α(α(π-πe)-x *)=0 Setting π = πe as in the medium run and re-arranging yields; π D=αx */λ, x D=0 Note that x = the output gap = 0 in the medium run Inflation Bias 10 Equilibrium inflation and output The argument that π = πe in the medium run is means that the Phillips Curve will adversely shift as the private sector anticipates expansionary policy if inflation is too low. 11 Barro-Gordon: inflation bias Inflation, π output gap, xx*.0 Phillips Curve (πe = 0) 0 Phillips Curve (π e = πe ) πD • The source of such a positive inflation bias is the rational expectations – wages are set on wage setters’ expectations of the policy-maker’s actions not on announcements. • Such an inflation bias arises from the time-inconsistency of ‘initially optimal’ policies (Kydland and Prescott 1977).
