However, the open economy approach is very important for some countries, such as the UK. • We are going to focus on one aspect of open economy macroeconomics: exchange rate fluctuations. • Since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1973, most countries allowed their exchange rates to float. Learning Objectives Under this topic, we will learn about: • Exchange rate swings • The Dornbusch (Exchange rate overshooting) model • The effect of an increase in the money supply in the Dornbusch model • Implications of the Dornbusch model Exchange Rate Swings 130 135 140 145 150 155 160 165 170 Nominal Effective Exchange Rate of £ (Source: IMF International Financial Statistics) • The era of flexible exchange rates has been characterised by major exchange rate swings. • An exchange rate swing refers to a change in the exchange rate by 20% or more over a period of 1-2 years. Exchange Rate Swings • Economists wanted to find out whether these big swings • were due to “irrational” speculative behaviour by exchange rate traders or • whether they could be explained by systematic macroeconomic forces in which expectations remained “rational” • This question surfaced in the 1970s as the idea of “rational expectations” was being introduced into macroeconomics by the New Classical School then, as we have seen. • An answer to this question was proposed by Rudiger Dornbusch. • Remark: the well-known Mundell-Fleming open-economy macro model not only takes no account of expectations, but it also assumes a fixed price level, which limits its relevance to only short horizons. The Dornbusch Model • Dornbusch suggested that big exchange rate swings can be consistent with rational expectations. • His analysis became to be known as the exchange rate overshooting model. • The model is eclectic, since it combines the New Classical assumption of rational expectations with the New Keynesian assumption of sticky prices. • It is, however, not New Keynesian as it does not provide micro foundations for the structural macroeconomic relationships. Source: Dornbusch Rüdiger (1942-2002) – The Ideas of Economists The Dornbusch Model • The originality of Dornbusch's work lies in his exploration of the outcome of an important observation. • While product markets adjust only slowly, financial markets appear to adjust far more rapidly. • The consequence of allowing for this feature of the real world turns out to be that financial markets have to over adjust to disturbances, in order to compensate for the stickiness of prices in goods markets. The Dornbusch Model • Notations: • Lower case symbols denote natural logs (except for the domestic and foreign real interest rate). • The country is small, and hence, takes foreign variables denoted by a * as given. • Definitions: • 𝑆𝑆: nominal exchange rate (price of 1 unit of foreign currency in terms of domestic currency) • Q = 𝑆𝑆𝑃𝑃∗ 𝑃𝑃 : real exchange rate (price of 1 unit of foreign goods in terms of home goods) with 𝑃𝑃: domestic price level and 𝑃𝑃∗: foreign price level The Dornbusch Model • Time is a continuous variable so proportional rates of change over time are measured as: • 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = ̇𝑝𝑝 = ̇𝑃𝑃 𝑃𝑃 : rate of inflation • 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = ̇𝑠𝑠 = ̇𝑆𝑆 𝑆𝑆 : rate of exchange rate depreciation • Assumption 1: Perfect international capital mobility • 𝒓𝒓 = 𝒓𝒓∗ + ̇𝒔𝒔𝒆𝒆 (uncovered interest parity - UIP) where ̇𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒 denotes expected exchange rate depreciation, 𝑟𝑟 and 𝑟𝑟∗ denote domestic and foreign nominal interest rate, respectively. • No-arbitrage condition The Dornbusch Model • Assumption 2: expectations, ̇𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒 are formed rationally • ̇𝒔𝒔𝒆𝒆 = 𝜽𝜽( ̄𝒔𝒔 − 𝒔𝒔) where ̄𝑠𝑠 denotes the long-run equilibrium exchange rate and 𝜃𝜃 is a speed of adjustment parameter. • This implies that when the exchange rate is below its long-run equilibrium level in the short- run, there will be a natural expectation that its future path will carry it upward in the direction of equilibrium, rather than away from equilibrium, and vice versa. • Moreover, the further the exchange rate, 𝑠𝑠 from its long-run equilibrium value, ̄𝑠𝑠 the faster it will adjust towards it. • Dornbusch shows how we can solve for 𝜃𝜃 as a function of the other parameters of the model. The Dornbusch Model • The Money Market: • Equilibrium in the money market is given by 𝒎𝒎 − 𝒑𝒑 = 𝒌𝒌 ̄𝒚𝒚 − 𝒍𝒍𝒓𝒓 (LM) where 𝑚𝑚 denotes money supply (in logs) and ̄𝑦𝑦 denotes the long-run output (in logs), with 𝑘𝑘, 𝑙𝑙 > 0. • Money supply is treated as the exogenous instrument of monetary policy. • Money demand is given by a standard looking function, but Dornbusch simplifies it by assuming the income variable is not given by current income, 𝑦𝑦. • Instead, it is given by ̄𝑦𝑦, the long-run or full-employment level of income. The Dornbusch Model • The goods market: • The demand for goods is given by: 𝒚𝒚𝒅𝒅 = 𝒉𝒉(𝒔𝒔 − 𝒑𝒑) (IS) where 𝒚𝒚 𝒅𝒅 denotes demand for home output and ℎ > 0. • A reduced-form IS equation, where 𝑠𝑠 − 𝑝𝑝 is equal to the real exchange rate, 𝑞𝑞, with 𝑝𝑝∗ normalized to zero. • An increase in (𝑠𝑠 − 𝑝𝑝) corresponds to a depreciation of the domestic currency, making home goods cheaper. This results in an increase in net exports, raising total demand for home output (ℎ > 0). • This is also a simplified IS equation, which omits 𝑟𝑟 with a negative coefficient and any exogenous component of demand on the RHS. The Dornbusch Model • The goods market (cont’d): • Supply of output is assumed to be given by the long-run level of output, ̄𝑦𝑦. • Price adjustment is then given by ̇𝒑𝒑 = 𝝅𝝅(𝒚𝒚 𝒅𝒅 − ̄𝒚𝒚) (Phillips Curve) with 𝜋𝜋 > 0. • This is the Keynesian element in Dornbusch’s model, as it shows that the price level only adjusts gradually in response to excess demand for goods, i.e. outside the long-run 𝒚𝒚 𝒅𝒅 is not equal to ̄𝒚𝒚. • Note that Dornbusch does not include inflation expectations in the Phillips Curve. • Dornbusch also assumes actual output, 𝑦𝑦 is always equal to ̄𝑦𝑦. The Dornbusch Model • To summarise, the model consists of the following five equations: 𝒓𝒓 = 𝒓𝒓∗ + ̇𝒔𝒔𝒆𝒆 UIP ̇𝒔𝒔𝒆𝒆 = 𝜽𝜽( ̄𝒔𝒔 − 𝒔𝒔) exchange rate expectations 𝒎𝒎 − 𝒑𝒑 = 𝒌𝒌 ̄𝒚𝒚 − 𝒍𝒍𝒓𝒓 LM 𝒚𝒚𝒅𝒅 = 𝒉𝒉(𝒔𝒔 − 𝒑𝒑) IS ̇𝒑𝒑 = 𝝅𝝅(𝒚𝒚𝒅𝒅 − ̄𝒚𝒚) Phillips Curve The Dornbusch Model • We can reduce these 5 equations into equation (1) and (2) below in (𝑠𝑠, 𝑝𝑝, ̇𝑝𝑝). • Substitute exchange rate expectations in the UIP and then the UIP equation into LM and rearrange to obtain 𝒑𝒑 = 𝑳𝑳 + 𝒍𝒍𝜽𝜽 ̄𝒔𝒔 − 𝒔𝒔 (1) where 𝑳𝑳 ≡ 𝒎𝒎 − 𝒌𝒌 ̄𝒚𝒚 + 𝒍𝒍𝒓𝒓∗. • Then, substitute the IS equation, 𝑦𝑦𝑑𝑑 = ℎ(𝑠𝑠 − 𝑝𝑝) into the Phillips Curve equation, ̇𝑝𝑝 = 𝜋𝜋(𝑦𝑦𝑑𝑑 − ̄𝑦𝑦) to get ̇𝒑𝒑 = 𝝅𝝅[𝒉𝒉(𝒔𝒔 − 𝒑𝒑) − ̄𝒚𝒚] (2) The Long-run Equilibrium in the Dornbusch Model • It is easiest to understand how the model works by starting at the long-run equilibrium (or the steady-state). The long-run is defined as where ̇𝑝𝑝 = 0 and ̇𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒 = 0. • Setting ̇𝑝𝑝 = 0 in equation (2), and then setting ̇𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒 = 0 in equation (1), we have ̄𝒑𝒑 = 𝑳𝑳 (≡ 𝒎𝒎 − 𝒌𝒌 ̄𝒚𝒚 + 𝒍𝒍𝒓𝒓 ∗) • Lastly, substituting ̄𝑝𝑝 from above into the equation obtained by setting ̇𝑝𝑝 = 0 in equation (2), yields: ̄𝒔𝒔 = 𝒎𝒎 + (𝟏𝟏/𝒉𝒉 − 𝒌𝒌) ̄𝒚𝒚 + 𝒍𝒍𝒓𝒓∗ • Looking at these two equations, we can see that an increase in the level of the money supply, 𝑚𝑚 produces an equal proportional increase in the price level, 𝑝𝑝 and in the nominal exchange rate, 𝑠𝑠. The Long-run Equilibrium in the Dornbusch Model • In other words, money is neutral in the long-run: it does not affect the real variables in the economy. • The long-run gives enough time for the price level to fully adjust. • Hence, the economy has “classical” properties in the long-run. Dynamic Adjustment in the Dornbusch Model • To study the dynamics of the model when it is not at the steady-state, first, we rewrite equations (1) and (2) for 𝑝𝑝 and ̇𝑝𝑝 in ‘deviation’ forms. • Equation (1) shows the ‘static’ equation linking 𝑝𝑝 and 𝑠𝑠: 𝑝𝑝 = 𝐿𝐿 + 𝑙𝑙𝜃𝜃( ̄𝑠𝑠 − 𝑠𝑠) • In the steady state, ̄𝑠𝑠 = 𝑠𝑠. Hence, this becomes: ̄𝑝𝑝 = 𝐿𝐿 • Subtracting this from the equation above: 𝒑𝒑 − ̄𝒑𝒑 = −𝒍𝒍𝜽𝜽(𝒔𝒔 − ̄𝒔𝒔) • This is the equation for 𝑝𝑝 in deviation form. Dynamic Adjustment in the Dornbusch Model • Remember also the equation for ̇𝑝𝑝, equation (2): ̇𝑝𝑝 = 𝜋𝜋[ℎ(𝑠𝑠 − 𝑝𝑝) − ̄𝑦𝑦] • In the steady state, ̇𝑝𝑝 = 0. Hence, this becomes: 0 = 𝜋𝜋[ℎ( ̄𝑠𝑠 − ̄𝑝𝑝) − ̄𝑦𝑦] • Subtract this from the equation above: ̇𝒑𝒑 = 𝝅𝝅𝒉𝒉[(𝒔𝒔 − 𝒑𝒑) 𝒒𝒒 − ( ̄𝒔𝒔 − ̄𝒑𝒑) ̄𝒒𝒒 ] • This is the equation for ̇𝑝𝑝 in deviation form. Dynamic Adjustment in the Dornbusch Model • To study the dynamics of the model when it is not at the steady-state, we will use a diagram. • To draw the diagram showing the adjustment dynamics, we use the deviation equation for ̇𝑝𝑝 to find the locus points, where ̇𝑝𝑝 = 0: ̇𝒑𝒑 = 𝟎𝟎: 𝒔𝒔 = 𝒑𝒑 + ̄𝒒𝒒 • In addition, we use the equation for 𝑝𝑝 in deviation form and call it the MM line, MM: 𝒑𝒑 − ̄𝒑𝒑 = −𝒍𝒍𝜽𝜽(𝒔𝒔 − ̄𝒔𝒔) Dynamic Adjustment in the Dornbusch Model • Note that the economy must be on the MM line even in the short-run, but it is only on the ̇𝑝𝑝 = 0 line in the long-run. • This implies when ̇𝑝𝑝 ≠ 0, the economy converges to the steady-state on the MM line. • Note that 𝑝𝑝 is a pre-determined variable, i.e. it cannot jump, whereas 𝑠𝑠 can jump, as it is not pre-determined. A permanent increase in the money supply • Suppose the money supply increases from 𝑚𝑚0 to 𝑚𝑚1. • We already know that in the long-run, an increase in the level of the money supply, 𝑚𝑚 produces an equal proportional increase in the price level and in the nominal exchange rate. • How about the short-run? • The increase in the money supply does not shift ̇𝑝𝑝 = 0 locus, as 𝑚𝑚 does not enter the equation (𝑠𝑠 = 𝑝𝑝 + ̄𝑞𝑞) obtained using ̇𝑝𝑝 = 0. • On the other hand, since higher 𝑚𝑚 increases the values for ̄𝑝𝑝 and ̄𝑠𝑠, we know the MM line must pass through the new ( ̅𝑝𝑝1, ̅𝑠𝑠1) with an unchanged slope: MM line shifts up. A permanent increase in the money supply s p s p MM 0p = 0p < 0p > q 45o • Remember 𝑝𝑝 can only change gradually as prices are sticky. • However, the economy must be on the MM line even in the short-run. • Conclusion: the economy needs to jump from point A to B the moment the money supply increases, and then gradually converge to point C along the new MM line. • Hence, the exchange rate “overshoots”: it goes beyond its long-run value in the short – run and then tends back towards it. (𝑚𝑚0) MM (𝑚𝑚1) A B C ̅𝑝𝑝1 ̅𝑠𝑠1 Comment: rationality of exchange rate expectations • The Dornbusch model assumes on an ad-hoc basis that exchange rate expectations are given by: ̇𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒 = 𝜃𝜃( ̄𝑠𝑠 − 𝑠𝑠) • Is the expected exchange rate depreciation implied by this, ̇𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒 equal to the actual rate of depreciation, ̇𝑠𝑠? • Using the equation above, on impact (when the money supply increases) we have 𝑠𝑠 > ̄𝑠𝑠, and hence ̇𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒 < 0. • Looking at the time path of the exchange rate, we can see ̇𝑠𝑠 < 0. • Hence, the expectations assumption does correctly forecast the sign of ̇𝑠𝑠. • However, for an arbitrary value of 𝜃𝜃, it won’t be the case that ̇𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒 = ̇𝑠𝑠 exactly. Dornbusch shows that there is a particular value of 𝜃𝜃 for which ̇𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒 = ̇𝑠𝑠 all the way along the adjustment path. Implication of the Dornbusch model • The model demonstrates how we can have large exchange rate swings, even with rational expectations. • Hence, large exchange rate swings are not necessarily a sign of traders in the forex market having irrational expectations about the future of exchange rates. • Their expectations are linked to fundamentals of the economy. Intuitive Explanation of Overshooting • The increased money supply leads to excess supply in the money market. Prices are sticky so the real interest rate must fall to restore equilibrium: 𝒎𝒎 − 𝒑𝒑 = 𝒌𝒌 ̄𝒚𝒚 − 𝒍𝒍𝒓𝒓 • The decrease in the domestic real interest rate results in a negative interest rate differential. Hence, ̇𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒 must become negative to maintain the UIP condition: 𝒓𝒓 = 𝒓𝒓∗ + ̇𝒔𝒔𝒆𝒆 • In other words, investors expect the home currency to appreciate. • In the long-run, we know s will be higher (i.e. depreciate) in proportion to the rise in m. • The only way for s to be higher in the long-run but be falling (as correctly expected) along the transition path is for s to jump beyond the new long-run value, i.e. initially depreciate more. Comments on the overshooting • The “intuitive” explanation shows that rational expectations play a key role in causing overshooting, as the logic of why the exchange rate overshoots would break down if we don’t have ̇𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒 = ̇𝑠𝑠. • This explanation also shows that sticky prices play a key role in causing overshooting, as 𝑝𝑝 would immediately increase in proportion to 𝑚𝑚 if prices were flexible and 𝑟𝑟 would not decrease. • ̇𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒 would then remain constant and 𝑠𝑠 would immediately jump to its higher long-run value without overshooting. Comments on the overshooting • Notice that since 𝑝𝑝 does not change on impact, the real exchange rate (𝑠𝑠 − 𝑝𝑝) also depreciates on impact. • Through the IS (𝑦𝑦𝑑𝑑 = ℎ(𝑠𝑠 − 𝑝𝑝)), we know that the depreciation of the real exchange rate results in an increase in real output, i.e. causes a boom if we assume 𝑦𝑦𝑑𝑑 = 𝑦𝑦. • In this case, the overshooting of the exchange rate can be thought to result in a boom in the short-run by departing real output from its long-run level. • However, recall that Dornbusch assumes 𝑦𝑦 = ̄𝑦𝑦, in which case real output does not change. Comments on the overshooting • In our analysis here, we assumed that the change in the money supply by policy-makers was unexpected. • In an important extension of the Dornbusch model where the money supply change is anticipated, it has been shown that the overshooting in this case would be lower. • Intuitively, the reason is that, from the moment the markets become aware that the money supply is going to increase, they would change their judgement about the long-run equilibrium. • The result is then for the whole process of adjustment to start immediately, thereby smoothing somewhat the impact of the money supply increase, when it actually takes place. • It is important to note that this approach assumes that the market is correct in anticipating a money supply increase. • In practice, the markets may often anticipate monetary policy changes that fail to materialize, causing exchange rate movements that cannot be rationalized. Application of the Dornbusch model to the UK example • The marked appreciation of the £ coincided with the election of the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher and a regime of lowering monetary growth to tackle high inflation. • Although the shape of the time path of the £ is not given by a jump as implied by the Dornbusch model, this could be due to the monetary growth being lowered progressively. • Note, however, how the appreciation of the £ was initially higher than the level it later converged to, as demonstrated by the model.130 135 140 145 150 155 160 165 170 Nominal Effective Exchange Rate of £ (Source: IMF International Financial Statistics) References • Copeland, L., Exchange Rates and International Finance (2005, 4th edition, Pearson), Ch. 7 “Sticky Prices: The Dornbusch Model” [Reading advice: Essential].","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
