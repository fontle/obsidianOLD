The budget constraint is the combination of all the bundles such that Anna spends her entire endowment, 2𝑥1 + 1𝑥2 = 12 b. The marginal utilities are given by the partial derivatives of utility with respect to each good: 𝜕𝑈 𝜕𝑥1 = 𝑥 2 3 2 3𝑥 2 3 1 𝜕𝑈 𝜕𝑥2 = 2𝑥 1 3 1 3𝑥 1 3 2 c. The optimal quantities can be obtained through the Lagrangian technique, however the standard solution to the Cobb-Douglas function is: 𝑝1𝑥1 𝑎 = 𝑝2𝑥2 𝑏 → 𝑥1 = 𝑎𝑝2𝑥2 𝑝1𝑏 Substituting parameters: 𝑥1 = 1 3 × 1 × 𝑥2 2 × 2 3 = 𝑥2 4 To obtain optimal quantities we can substitute into the budget constraint: 2 [ 𝑥2 4 ] + 𝑥2 = 12 → 𝑥2 = 8 2𝑥1 + 8 = 12 → 𝑥1 = 2 d. Ceteris paribus, a change in the price of good 1 to half of its original price would double the optimal quantity: 𝑥1 = 1 1 × 𝑎𝑝2𝑥2 𝑏 → 𝑥1 = 𝑥2 2 Substituting into the budget constraint 2 [ 𝑥2 2 ] + 𝑥2 = 12 → 𝑥2 = 6 2𝑥1 + 6 = 12 → 𝑥1 = 3 1","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
