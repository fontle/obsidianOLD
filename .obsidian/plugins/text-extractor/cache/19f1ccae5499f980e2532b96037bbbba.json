Extending the Barro-Gordon framework to include uncertainty. Suppose shocks to the Phillips Curve. (Technically: ‘cost- push’ shocks.) Then inflation volatility also will be lower under CBI. But output is predicted to be more volatile under independent central banks. (This is the ‘price’ of inflation stability.) Evidence?

Inflation Bias No average growth effect. But also no apparent volatility cost either. (Is this a ‘competence’ benefit?) Conclusion- CBI reduces inflation at no apparent real cost. Free lunch? Inflation Bias Summary of existing empirical evidence • CBI appears to reduce inflation in high income countries almost irrespective of the CBI measure used. • In less developed countries, the evidence is mixed. In most cases, empirical studies find no statistically significant relationship between CBI and equilibrium inflation. (e.g. see Campillo and Miron, 1997).
