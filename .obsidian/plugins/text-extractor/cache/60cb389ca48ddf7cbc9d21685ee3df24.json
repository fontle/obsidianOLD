Introduction 3 Introduction Another rationale for increased CBI Which potentially explains the lack of increased real economic volatility.) Reduced Politically-Induced macroeconomic volatility. Political Business Cycles 4 Political Business Cycles ‘Opportunistic Political Business Cycles’ ‘Pre-electoral booms’ 1. Do they exist? (Actually surprisingly little systematic evidence.) 2. Do voters respond to the economy? Yes – but in a qualified way. – E.g. see Maloney and Pickering (2015). Voting and the Economic Cycle, Public Choice. Political Business Cycles 5 Political Business Cycles ‘Partisan Political Business Cycles’ Idea that macroeconomic outcomes depend on the party of office: e.g. see http:// www.vox.com/2014/7/29/5945583/the-us-economy-grows-fast er-under-democratic-presidents-is-that-just (Though note that differences of these magnitude are likely to be due to other factors) Political Business Cycles 6 Political Business Cycles Political Business Cycles 7 Political Business Cycles ‘Rational Partisan Political Business Cycles’ • Post-Electoral Fluctuations • Pre-Electoral Fluctuations Fluctuations depend on • Wage contracts overlapping elections • Uncertainty and expectations of election results Political Business Cycles 8 Political Business Cycles (This discussion follows Maloney, Pickering and Hadri, 2003) The government’s objective (loss) function: where: α is the relative importance of inflation over output; πs is the inflation rate; π i is the partisan preferred inflation rate; i = L, R (hence Left- or Right-wing); ys is the deviation in output from the natural rate.   22 5050 s i s i s y.ππα. L   22 5050 s i s i s y.ππα. L Political Business Cycles 9 Political Business Cycles The aggregate supply (Phillips Curve) constraint: where 0 <  < 1 captures persistence; zt is a supply shock with expected value zero; is average nominal wage growth at time t.   ttttt zWyy   ˆ 1  tWˆ   ttttt zWyy   ˆ 1  tWˆ Political Business Cycles 10 Political Business Cycles Outcomes Medium-run: output gap = 0, higher inflation under the left-wing regime.

Estimation: Key parameters: b3 and b4 (as before), but now also b9 and b10. These should have the opposite sign to b3 and b4 respectively.

Central Bank Independence Central Bank Independence RPBCs depend on expectation of election result. Evidence from the OECD supports the existence of RPBCs. Central Bank Independence reduces Political Business Cycles – perhaps explaining why Alesina and Summers (1993) find no relationship between CBI and (overall) output volatility.
