Two-period Diagram y and c in period 2 y and c in period 1 y1 y2 c1 c2 Loan = L Re-payment = L(1+r) • Or she could save in period 1 in order to consume more than y2 in period 2. • Her consumption need not match her income in each period – she faces an intertemporal budget constraint - with slope -(1+r). c2= (y1- c1)(1+r) + y2 • Where she chooses on this budget line depends on her preferences for consumption in the two periods. Maths Consumption: Intertemporal Choice • Allocation of consumption over time • Maximise expected utility subject to a budget constraint • Economy with large numbers of identical individuals – the

Euler equation, an individual selects consumption in periods t and t+1. • She cannot increase her utility (U) by consuming less (more) in one period and more (less) in another, remaining on her budget constraint. • No uncertainty assumed here - so no expectation term in the Euler equation. • Suppose the individual reduces her consumption by one unit (£1) in period t, enabling her (by the budget constraint) to spend £(1+r) more in period t+1. • If her consumption were optimal, her utility would not be improved. • The unit reduction in consumption in period t will reduce utility (U) by:   
