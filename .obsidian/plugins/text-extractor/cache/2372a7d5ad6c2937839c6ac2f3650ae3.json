Rules versus discretion – – discretion is flexible – rules are credible • The reason why the government is able to diverge from its announcements is that it implements policy by discretion. • What if the policy maker was able to pre- commit to zero inflation? Inflation Bias Policy under commitment • Returning to the above problem with commitment, the policymaker commits to π=π e =0, and if credible then: Which is the best feasible outcome (see next slide) • In practice, however, commitment is not easily established. In particular, it may not be credible. Inflation Bias 4 Model with commitment Inflation, π output gap, xx*.0 Phillips Curve (πe = 0) 0 Phillips Curve (π e = πe ) πD Independent central banks (CB) Instrument independence (e.g. FRB, BoE, ECB): CB sets monetary policy – i.e. can set short term interest rates and/or set the money supply. Objective independence: CB determines policy goals – e.g. chooses price stability/inflation target/output stabilisation. Delegation Inflation Bias Rogoff (1985) Suppose that monetary policy is made by an independent CB whose preferences are given by L CB=μπ²+(x-x *)² where μ > λ. This means greater inflation aversion and more elliptical loss funcions (see next slide). The outcome is now π CB=αx */μ xCB=0 The ‘Conservative Central Banker’ Inflation Bias 7 The ‘Conservative’ Central Banker Inflation, π output gap, xx*.0 Phillips Curve (πe = 0) 0 Phillips Curve (πe = πe ) πD πCB • Given that μ > λ - CB is more conservative than the government - inflation under an independent CB is lower than when monetary policy is made by the government itself. • Evidence?
