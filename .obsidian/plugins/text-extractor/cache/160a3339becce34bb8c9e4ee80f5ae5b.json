G. Mankiw, D. Romer & D. N. Weil (1992) “A Contribution to the Empirics of Economic Growth” Quarterly Journal of Economics vol. 107, no. 2, pp. 407-437. 6 A problem with the simple Solow model Source: Mankiw, Romer and Weil The Solow model predicts: (cf Solow-Swan Evidence lecture) Assume that                    log log log( ) 1 Y s A N n                    log log log( ) 1 Y s A N n 7 A problem with the simple Solow model Hence In words: log GDP per capita should depend positively on savings, and negatively on the population growth rate (Taking values of and as given, and .) Moreover, the elasticity of to 8 A problem with the simple Solow model Econometric Evidence: Table 1 in Mankiw, Romer and Weil (next slide) Key problem: Estimates of the elasticity of to s (measured as log investment/GDP) and are too high for the model. 910 Adding Human Capital to the Solow model A different production function: Where H is human capital and other variables are defined as before. Rewrite in ‘intensive form’ (dropping the time subscripts for convenience): Where 11 Adding Human Capital to the Solow model The ‘equations of motion’ for k and h are given by: (note depreciation the same for both types of capital) = fraction of income invested in physical capital. = fraction of income invested in human capital. 12 Adding Human Capital to the Solow model In the steady state, then both equations above are equal to zero. Solving simultaneously yields: 13 Adding Human Capital to the Solow model Substituting into the production function yields: Note different from the standard Solow ‘steady state’ solution. Hence: (equation (11) in Mankiw, Romer & Weil, 1992). 14 Estimating the MRW (augmented Solow) model Note key issues: (i) Response of GDP to savings () now bigger: savings increases income, which increases human capital, which increases the returns to investment (ii) measured as school enrolment rates (fraction of 12- 17 year olds at school) (iii) argued to be around 0.5. (e.g. difference between the average and minimum wage in the US). Econometric Evidence: Table 2 in Mankiw, Romer and Weil (next slide) 1516 Estimating the MRW model Note findings: (i) Response of GDP to savings () positive and statistically significant. (ii) Response of GDP to () negative and ‘large’ as anticipated in (11). (iii) Response of GDP to investment in schooling positive and significant in all cases. 17 Final Thoughts on MRW Human capital is important in determining living standards Model fits international data quite well, but: 1. Evidence could be indicating other mechanisms – Education as consumption? – Population growth as an outcome (indeed related to living standards) rather than exogenous? – High returns to investment are consistent with other models of economic growth. 2.
