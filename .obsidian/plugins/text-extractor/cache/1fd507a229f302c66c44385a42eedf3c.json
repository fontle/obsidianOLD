For simplicity, depreciation is straight-line to 0. The required return is 12%, and the tax rate is 34%. In addition, we have compiled the following information: Base case Lower bound Upper bound Unit sales 6,000 5,500 6,500 Price per unit 80 75 85 Variable costs per unit 60 58 62 Fixed costs per year 50,000 45,000 55,000 6 Base case NPV Sales Variable costs Fixed costs Depreciation Profit before tax Taxes Net income Operating CF per year: NPV (base case): 7 Best case vs. worst case Base case Worst case Best case Unit sales 6,000 5,500 6,500 Price per unit 80 75 85 Variable costs per unit 60 62 58 Fixed costs per year 50,000 55,000 45,000 8 Worst case NPV Sales Variable costs Fixed costs Depreciation Profit before tax Taxes Net income Operating CF per year: NPV (worst case): 9 Best case NPV Sales Variable costs Fixed costs Depreciation Profit before tax Taxes Net income Operating CF per year: NPV (worst case): 10 In comparison Scenario Net income CF NPV IRR (%) Base Worst Best 11 • However, using the worst-best scenarios might be misleading/not enough • Instead, we could go with several optimistic and pessimistic cases 12 Sensitivity analysis • Investigation of what happens to NPV when only one variable is changed 13 Case study 1 (cont.) • Back to our case study • Repeat the analysis when we only change the unit sales Base case Worst case Best case Unit sales 6,000 5,500 6,500 Price per unit 80 80 80 Variable costs per unit 60 60 60 Fixed costs per year 50,000 50,000 50,000 14 Case study 1 (cont.) • Back to our case study • Repeat the analysis when we only change the fixed costs Base case Worst case Best case Unit sales 6,000 6,000 6,000 Price per unit 80 80 80 Variable costs per unit 60 60 60 Fixed costs per year 50,000 55,000 45,000 15 Only change the unit sales Scenario Base Worst Best Net income CF NPV IRR 16 Only change the fixed costs Scenario Base Worst Best Net income CF NPV IRR 17 Break-even analysis • Variable costs • Costs that change when the quantity of output changes • Fixed costs • Costs that do not change when the quantity of output changes during a particular time period • Total costs = variable costs + fixed costs • Marginal (incremental) cost: the change in costs that occurs when there is a small change in output • Marginal (incremental) revenue: the change in revenue that occurs when there is a small change in output 18 Accounting break-even • The sales level that results in zero project net income 19 Case study 2 Suppose we retail USB flash drives for £5 apiece. We can buy drives from a wholesale supplier for £3 apiece. We have accounting expenses of £600 in fixed costs and £300 in depreciation. How many drives do we have to sell to break even – that is, for net income to be zero? 20 Sales Variables costs Fixed costs Depreciation Profit before tax Taxes Net income 21 Why accounting break even? • Relatively easy to calculate • Help reduce forecasting risk • A project that does not break even in an accounting sense reduces total earnings • A project that just breaks even on an accounting basis loses money in a financial or opportunity cost sense 22 More generally… • If ignoring taxes, operating cash flow (OCF) can be written as EBIT plus depreciation: • Q is the sales volume needed to achieve any given OCF 23 Other break-even measures • Cash break-even: the sales level that results in a zero operating cash flow • Financial break-even: the sales level that results in a zero NPV 24 Operating leverage • Operating leverage is the degree to which a firm or project relies on fixed costs • Degree of operating leverage (DOL): the percentage change in operating cash flow relative to the percentage change in quantity sold 25 Implications of operating leverage • Fixed costs act as a lever in the sense that a small percentage change in operating revenue can be magnified into a large percentage change in operating cash flow and NPV • The higher the degree of operating leverage, the greater is the potential danger from forecasting risk • From a managerial perspective, one way of coping with highly uncertain projects is to keep the degree of operating leverage as low as possible. This will generally have the effect of maintaining the break-even point (however measured) at its minimum level 26 Capital rationing • Capital rationing refers to the situation that exists if a firm has positive-NPV projects but cannot find the necessary financing • Soft rationing refers to the situation that occurs when units in a business are allocated a certain amount of financing for capital budgeting • Hard rationing refers to the situation that occurs when a business cannot raise financing for a project under any circumstances 27 Example Consider the following investment opportunities: The required rate of return is 10%. What would be the investment decision if there is no capital rationing? How would the decision change if the firm applies capital rationing by restricting the total fund for investments to £10 mil? Project Year 0 1 2 3 4 A -5 mil 4 mil 4 mil 4 mil 4 mil B -7 mil 10 mil 10 mil 10 mil 10 mil C -3 mil 2 mil 2 mil 2 mil 2 mil 28 Advantages of capital rationing • Ensure a budget is followed • Optimal utilization of resources • More effective and efficient project management 29 Disadvantages of capital rationing • Applying capital rationing = focusing on short-term rather than long- term growth 30 Quiz 1 Wettway Yachts Ltd is considering whether to launch its new Margo-class yacht. The selling price will be £40,000 per boat. The variable costs will be £20,000 per boat, and fixed costs will be £500,000 per year. The total investment needed to undertake the project is £3,500,000. For simplicity, this amount will be depreciated straight-line to zero over the five- year life of the equipment. The salvage value is zero, and there are no working capital consequences. Wettway has a 20% required return on new projects. Based on market surveys and historical experience, Wettway projects total sales for the five years at 425 boats, or about 85 boats per year. Ignoring taxes, should this project be launched? 31 If we only use NPV 32 Take into account accounting break- even 33 Take into account cash break-even 34 Take into account financial break- even 35 Quiz 2 Please see the attached pdf 36 Practical example: Sensitivity/Scenario analysis using Excel Repeat Quiz 2 using Excel","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
