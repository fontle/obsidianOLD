The firm has already conducted market research costing £300,000 to assess the attractiveness of the proposed product. The projected sales volume is 110,000 units per year for the next 4 years, the sales price is £245 per unit, the production cost is £110 per unit. Introducing the new product will boost sales of an existing device of which the price and production cost are £100 per unit and £60 per unit, respectively. Assume that the increase in sales of the already existing device is 25% of the projected sales of the new product. Prior to the actual production during years 1-4, York Plc. has to design the packaging of the new product, costing £15 million. The project will require space for a new lab which will be housed in office space that the company would have otherwise rented out for £200,000 per year during years 1–4. The firm also needs to install new equipment that will require an upfront investment of £7.5 million and will be depreciated straight-line over 5 years. The estimated marketing and support cost for the new product is £2.8 million per year. The project will require no immediate net working capital but will require £2.1 million in net working capital each year during years 1–4. The corporate tax rate is 20% and the project discount rate is 12%. Calculate the project’s net present value. 22) Consider the following pre-merger information about a bidding firm (Firm B) and a target firm (Firm T). Assume that both firms have no debt outstanding. Firm B Firm T Shares outstanding 5,000 1,500 Price per share (£) 35 28 Firm B has estimated that the value of the synergistic benefits from acquiring Firm T is £10,000. There are 2 merger offers: a cash offer and a stock offer. With the cash offer, Firm T will be acquired for £32 per share in cash. With the stock offer, Firm B offers four of its shares for every five of Firm T’s shares. Calculate the net present value of the merger and the price per share of the merged firm in each case. Which offer is better for Firm T’s shareholders? At what exchange ratio of B shares to T shares would Firm T’s shareholders be indifferent between 2 offers? 23) The Board of Directors of York Inc. are designing an employment contract for the company’s new CEO. The CEO can exert either a high effort 𝑎𝐻 (the equivalent monetary value is 100,000) or a low effort 𝑎𝐿 (the equivalent monetary value is 20,000) in managing the company. The Board of Directors are expecting that effort will have an impact on the company’s earnings in the way given in the table below. They also know that the CEO has also offers from other companies providing her with a satisfaction level 𝑈̅ = 50,000. Effort/Result Success: 𝑥𝑆 = 1,000 Failure: 𝑥𝐹 = 100 High effort (𝑎𝐻) Probability of success: 90% Probability of failure: 10% Low effort (𝑎𝐿) Probability of success: 40% Probability of failure: 60% TURN OVER QUESTION CONTINUED OVERLEAF Page 6 of 6 The CEO’s utility function is given by: 𝑈 = 𝑤2 − 𝑒 Assume the CEO’s effort is not observable, derive the optimal contract. *****END OF EXAM*****","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
