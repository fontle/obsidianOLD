Globalisation refers to the process of economies becoming more integrated and interdependent, it involves the ‘transfers of commodities, people, capital and ideas between and within continents’.1 Depending on the time period, economic historians can use a variety of sources however the main two are: The value of trade, by analysing the value exports and imports historians can find insights into the degree of integration in global markets, a growth in trade over a period would highlight an increased market integration. Secondly,Migration, the move- ment of people between economies, highlights greater labour integration and enables the diffusion of ideas and knowledge, also indicative of a greater degree of globalisation. Historians can appraise the level of migration through ticket records for ships and trains, or exogenous variables such as disease exchanges. 2 Meanwhile, Taylor and Williamson used wages to measure the impact of mi- gration: between 1870-1914 caused wage dispersion to fall by 28%, showing a convergence between poor and richer countries. 3 1Judith.

It involved partial decentralisa- tion: returning of agriculture and other sectors such as retail back to private ownership. This allowed peasants to cultivate their own land and sell surplus on the market whilst engaging in small-scale trade. Furthermore, elements of monetary policy were re-introduced: a convertible currency backed by the gold standard called chervonets, allowing for greater trade with other economies. Economically, it was successful with economic growth in the period at 16.3% in the Soviet Union, far greater than any other CESEE economy, however when accounting for GDP levels pre World War I, the Soviet Union was the last to recover in 1928.4 4Morys, M.

State socialism is government system characterised by the central planning of the economy rather than market allocation through government fiat. On the other hand, in Das Kapital, Marx describes communism as the final stage of development, whilst socialism is the transitory period between capitalism and communism. He described a ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ where the work- ers seize the means of production creating an absence of a centralised state, and envisions the abolition of private property. 5Alternatively, state socialism heavily relies on central planning, through the nationalisation of industries, re- sources and key-sectors of the economy. For example, collectivisation of capital to workers under state socialism still resulted in significant control by the state: In Stalin’s first 5 year plan there were state-imposed quotas on individuals as both state-controlled (Sovkhozes) and collectively-controlled farms (Kolkhozes), thus the power of the state never truly turned to the hands of workers as en- visioned by communism. Since communism deviates from socialism in terms of the role of the state they should not be considered identical concepts, mean- while, since they both embody address the inequalities created by capitalism there are overlaps between the concepts. 5Marx, K, 1818-1883.

Table 2: Levels and rate of growth of real GDP per capita6 1870 GK$ 1990 1913 GK$ 1990 Growth 1870-1913 UK 3,191 4,921 1 Germany 1,913 3,833 1.6 US 2,445 5,301 1.8 Britain was the first economy to industrialise during the 18th century and ex- perienced unparalleled growth that was not seen by any economy previously. Despite being well ahead of Germany and the United States, its growth began to slow in during the second industrial revolution (1870-1914). As shown by table 2, the real rate of growth in the UK was 1.0 (constant) during the second industrial revolution, meanwhile Germany and the United States experienced 60% and 80% expansions in real GDP respectively during the same period. Table 3: National proportions of world manufacturing output 1860- 1913 8 1860 1880 1900 1913 UK 19.9 22.9 18.5 13.6 Germany 4.9 8.5 13.2 14.8 USA 7.2 14.7 23.6 32 Semantically, it is important to differentiate between absolute and relative de- cline. In Absolute terms, the British economy did not decline and thus did not face a recession, however, relative to other industrialising economies in Europe, Britain faced a stark decline in its proportion of global manufacturing output. As seen in figure three, the UK share of national manufacturing output was comparable to Germany and the United States in 1880 at 22.9%. By 1913 its national share fell to 13.6%, falling short of both Germany and the US with 14.8% and 32% respectively. Britain’s absolute stagnation and its relative de- cline must be framed in the context of the industrialisation of both Germany and the US, did Britain fall behind due to endogenous changes such as lack of 6Crafts, N.

Both the first and second industrial revolutions are hallmarked by major inno- vations: the former by steam and coal, and the latter built on electricity and combustion engines.9 In the first industrial revolution, the main inventors and entrepreneurs for motive power were British (Watts, Newcomen, etc.), as a re- sult, these domestic innovations were more easily utilised as the knowledge did not have to be imported from overseas. Furthermore, a combination of high wages and low energy costs created a unique circumstance in Britain that was not seen anywhere else in the world at the time.10 As a result, Britain had unique advantage that, in Allen’s view, enabled Britain to industrialise first due to its cheaper capital relative to labour. Consequently, Britain accumulated a lot of cutting edge capital (in the context of the first industrial revolution) by investing in mechanisation to replace the expensive labour. Since the rest the world was yet to reap the benefits of this technology, Britain’s output relative to total global output massively increased. Despite this, these relative gains were short-lived, the invention of the electric dynamo and internal combustion engines during the second industrial revolu- tion were not domestic innovations, the former by Gramme in Belgium and the latter by Otto in Germany. 11 These technological advancements created productivity gains in certain applications over steam: Watt’s engine was only able to convert 2 percent of the thermal energy compared to Otto’s engine at 12%. 12 Furthermore, advancements in chemistry, textiles, and transportation were mostly invented and faster adopted in Germany and the United States. In chemistry, the vulcanisation process that made industrial use of rubber possi- ble was was invented in 1839, whilst John Hyatt synthesised the first plastic in 1869. In textiles, Northrop built the first automatic loom in 1894 and it was widely adopted in the US, by this point, Mokyr argues that Britain’s textile industries had lost their position at the cutting edge of technology since the adoption of the Northrop loom was slow. 13 Another notable advancement not in technology was not necessarily an invention but a production process which enabled greater productivity - ‘The American System of Manufactures’. Focused on interchangeability and standardisation, it proved far superior to the skilled artisan and quickly replaced them across the New World. As opposed to Eu- 9Smil, V. (2005).

The importance of this system in the dominance of America during the second industrial revolution cannot be un- derstated, not only did American output exceed both Britain’s and Germany’s output combined but Goodfriend and McDermott suppose that American out- put was 2.21 times higher by 2000 than if the system did not exist.14 Combined, these advancements shed a light onto the late Victorian decline of the British economy suppose there was less initial inertia in the adoption of new technolo- gies described above, the British economy may have retained its spot as the largest producer in the world. 14Goodfriend, M., McDermott, J.
