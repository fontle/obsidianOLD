False, increased investment from lower real interest rates increase the demand for labour. 4. False, since real interest rates have lowered, interest payments decrease, improving the budget deficit. 5. Uncertain, in the long run it is possible for income to equal however only assuming technological progress and population growth result in no natural output growth in the long run, which is very unlikely. 6. Uncertain, in the medium run the interest rate is likely to return to since the initial increase in investment leads to higher output and increased infla- tion, reducing the real money stock, this in turn increases the real interest rate. However, in the long run, factors such as the savings rate influenced by productivity, animal spirits (investor expectations/confidence), and macroeconomic conditions impact the natural rate of interest, therefore it is very unlikely to remain unchanged. 7. False the adjustment is unlikely to occur in the short run, and instead only return to the steady state output in the medium run since 1 Section C Analyse the macroeconomic effects of contractionary fiscal policy in an open economy with a floating exchange rate [Word limit of 1000 words]. A contractionary fiscal policy is a type of government intervention that involves tightening the fiscal budget through increasing taxation or decreasing govern- ment spending. In an open economy would have a multifaceted impact on both the goods and financial market. In the domestic goods market, a contractionary fiscal policy reduces domestic demand (and thus equilibrium output) by reducing consumption and govern- ment spending. This can be shown algebraically through the aggregate demand relation (Blanchard, 2017): Aggregate demand relation in equilibrium: Rearranging for equilibrium output: This shows that an increase in and a decrease in both result in a decrease in equilibrium domestic production. Since the economy is open with a floating exchange rate, trade with other economies has to be taken into account in tandem with exchange rate to gain a full insight to the impact on the domestic goods market. In the open economy, net trade is taken into account in the aggregate demand relation to account for domestic demand for foreign goods (imports) and foreign demand for domestic goods (exports): With a floating exchange rate, the quantity of imports depends positively on the exchange rate and the negatively income of the domestic economy, whilst the quantity of exports depends positively on foreign income and negatively on the exchange rate. Since we have established that the domestic income decreases under a contractionary fiscal policy, the impact net trade is positive since imports are reduced and exports remain unchanged. However, this is not accounting for changes in exchange rates as a result of the changes in domestic demand. If we assume the interest parity relation to hold whereby domestic and foreign bonds have the same rate of returns, then it can be assumed that there is a positive correlation between interest rates and exchange rates. The reduction in domestic demand established previously would result in an inward shift in the IS-curve (and no change in the LM-curve since no monetary tools have been used). This model shows multiple economic phenomena. Firstly, that decrease in output from to as explained in the under our aggregate demand relation. Secondly, it shows the decrease in nominal interest rates as a result of reduced aggregate demand (less public borrowing and reduced expenditure on durables reduce the demand for loans and increase the interest rate). Finally, it shows the depreciation on the exchange rate as a result of decrease interest rates due to reduced hot money flows and the assumption of interest parity relation. The depreciation shown by the reduction in exchange rate from to in turn has an impact on the domestic goods economy by impacting trade. Imports de- 2 crease under the depreciation since the purchasing power of domestic consumers decreases, meanwhile the domestic economy becomes more internationally com- petitive since the depreciation reduces the prices of domestic goods for foreign buyers thus increasing exports. Therefore, it can be concluded that the con- tractionary fiscal policy is likely to improve the trade balance of the domestic economy. To conclude, contractionary fiscal policies in open economies with floating ex- change rates result in to counteracting phenomena on the domestic output equi- librium: The final result on domestic output depends on the extents to which each is effected within the macro economy. For example in the UK, where net trade is not a large component of total GDP, a contractionary fiscal policy is likely to reduce GDP relatively more than the same contractionary fiscal policy say in Saudi Arabia where exports comprise of a larger proportion of overall GDP (domestic output). As compared to a closed economy, an open economy has a small fiscal multiplier and thus the contractionary fiscal policy is likely to have less of an overall impact on equilibrium output in the short run.
