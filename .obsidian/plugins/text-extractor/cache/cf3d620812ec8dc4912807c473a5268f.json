Where should you start to create your business? 10 Early-stage financing and venture capital • Go to private equity and venture capital (VC) market • VC: financing for new, often high-risk, ventures • A large amount of private equity investment is undertaken by professional private equity managers representing large institutional investors such as mutual funds and pension funds 11 Stages of financing • Seed money: • A small amount of financing needed to prove a concept or develop a product. Marketing is not included in this stage. • Start-up: • Financing for firms that started within the past year. Funds are likely to pay for marketing and product development expenditures. • Later stage capital: • Additional money to begin sales and manufacturing after a firm has spent its start-up funds. • Growth capital: • Funds earmarked for a firm to enable it to reach its potential and achieve successful growth. • Replacement capital: • Financing for a company to buy out other investors in the firm. • Buyout financing: • Money provided for managers and outside investors to acquire a fully functioning firm. 12 Going public Source: Financial Times (2023) 13 The basic procedure 14 IPO process explained Alternative issue methods 15 The capital structure question Now that your firm is up and running. How should you choose the “right” debt-equity ratio (i.e., the “optimal” capital structure)? • How does financial leverage affect ROE/EPS? • How does financial leverage affect the cost of capital/cost of equity? 16 Debt vs. Equity • Interest is tax deductible → lowers the effective cost of debt • Debt holders are limited to a fixed return → stockholders do not have to share profits if the business does exceptionally well • Debt holders do not have voting rights • Higher debt ratios lead to greater risk and higher required interest rates (to compensate for the additional risk) 17 Maximizing firm value vs. maximizing shareholders’ interests The market value of J. J. Sprint plc is £1,000. The company currently has no debt, and each of J. J. Sprint’s 100 shares sells for £10. Suppose that J. J. Sprint plans to borrow £500 and pay the £500 proceeds to shareholders as an extra cash dividend of £5 per share, which leads to 3 possible outcomes below. In which scenario should the firm restructure? 18 Maximizing firm value vs. maximizing shareholders’ interests 19 Pay-offs to shareholders after restructuring (a) (b) (c) Equity value change (Capital gain) -250 -500 -750 Dividends 500 500 500 Net effect +250 0 -250 • Changes in capital structure benefit the shareholders if and only if the value of the firm increases • Optimal capital structure • maximize firm value • lowest possible WACC Financial leverage and EPS: Example (1) Current Proposed Assets (£) 8,000,000 8,000,000 Debt (£) 0 4,000,000 Equity (£) 8,000,000 4,000,000 Debt-equity ratio 0 1 Share price (£) 20 20 Shares outstanding 400,000 200,000 Interest rate (10%) 10 10 20 Recession Expected Expansion EBT (£) 500,000 1,000,000 1,500,000 Levered firm (use debt) Recession Expected Expansion EBT (£) 500,000 1,000,000 1,500,000 Interest (£) Net income (£) ROE (%) EPS (£) Unlevered firm (no debt) Recession Expected Expansion EBT (£) 500,000 1,000,000 1,500,000 Interest (£) Net income (£) ROE (%) EPS (£) Financial leverage and EPS: Example (2) 21 Financial leverage and firm value: Example (3) 22 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6EPS EBIT No debt With debt What do we learn from the example? • The effect of financial leverage depends on the company’s EBIT • When EBIT is relatively high, leverage is beneficial • Leverage: • magnifies returns (losses) to shareholders relative to no leverage case • Shareholders are exposed to more risk because the EPS and ROE are much more sensitive to changes in EBIT • Because of the impact that financial leverage has on both the expected return to shareholders and the riskiness of the equity, capital structure is an important consideration 23 Does conclusion #4 necessarily follow? • NO 24 Corporate borrowing and homemade leverage (1) Assume you have a chance to invest in the firm discussed in the earlier example and you can choose 1 of the following strategies: • Strategy A: buy 100 shares of the levered equity • Strategy B: • Borrow £2,000 from a bank • Use the borrowed proceeds plus your own investment of £2,000 (a total of £4,000) to buy 200 shares of the current unlevered equity @ £20 per share • Which strategy do you prefer? I.e., do you prefer investing in a levered or unlevered firm? 25 Corporate borrowing and homemade leverage (2) Recession Expected Expansion Strategy A: EPS of levered equity 0.50 3.00 5.50 Earnings for 100 shares Net cost = 26 Strategy B: Earnings for 200 shares Interest @10% on £2,000 Net earnings Initial cost = So what? • Capital structure seems to be irrelevant because shareholders can adjust the amount of financial leverage by borrowing and lending on their own • Homemade leverage: the use of personal borrowing to change the overall amount of financial leverage to which the individual is exposed 27 Notation D = market value of debt in levered firm E = market value of equity in levered firm VU = value of unlevered firm VL = D + E = value of levered firm EBIT = net operating income before interest and tax rE= return required on equity in levered firm rD = return required on debt in levered firm WACC = weighted average cost of capital tC = rate of corporation tax 28 The Modigliani-Miller (M&M) propositions 29 Assumption: perfect capital market • Investors and firms can trade the same set of securities at competitive market prices equal to the PV of their future cash flows • There are no taxes, transaction costs, or issuance costs associated with security trading • A firm’s financing decisions do not change the cash flows generated by its investments, nor do they reveal new information about them 30 MM1 - Proof (1) • Consider two firms in the same risk class: • one all-equity financed (unlevered) with value VU • the other levered with debt (D) and equity (E) and value VL • Now consider two alternative portfolio strategies: • Investment 1: Buy 10% of shares in unlevered firm U • Investment 2: Buy 10% of equity + 10% of debt of levered firm L 31 MM1 - Proof (2) • Investment 1 • Investment 2 32 M&M Proposition I • In a perfect capital market, the firm’s value is independent of its capital structure • In other words, the firm’s overall cost of capital, WACC, is NOT affected by the capital structure 33 MM2 - Proof (1) 𝑟𝐸 × 𝐸 𝐷 + 𝐸 + 𝑟𝐷 × 𝐷 𝐷 + 𝐸 = 𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐶 34 MM2 - Proof (2) • When the firm has only equity: 𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐶 = 𝑟𝑈 (1) • When the firm has both equity and debt: 𝑟𝐸 = 𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐶 + 𝐷 𝐸 𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐶 − 𝑟𝐷 (2) 35 M&M Proposition II • The cost of equity increases with the firm’s debt-equity ratio • In other words • The expected rate of return on the common stocks of a levered firm increases with the debt/equity ratio 36 To sum up • In a perfect capital market: • The overall return on firm, or overall return on assets, (WACC) remains constant (i.e., capital structure is irrelevant) • The required return on equity (rE) increases with debt to match the increased risk • This is because increasing debt increases the risk exposure of shareholders (recall they are residual claimants in case of default) • They will require a higher rate of return for this extra risk Implication: In a perfect capital market, any attempt to raise the value of the firm by issuing debt will be exactly offset by the increase in the cost of equity 37 What if the market is not perfect?

This is different from what we would expect from the static theory. Why? 49 Retained earnings • No adverse selection Debt • Minor adverse selection Equity • Serious adverse selection 50 Managers have private information have incentives to issue overpriced risky securities but also understand that issuing such securities will result in a negative price reaction because rational investors, who are at an information disadvantage, will discount the prices of any risky securities the firm issues → riskier securities are more subjective to adverse selection Pecking order theory • Pecking order theory: • Firms prefer internal to external finance • When external fund is necessary, firms prefer debt to equity • Implications: • No target capital structure • Profitable firms use less debt • Companies will want financial slack 51 Quiz 1 Pelamed Pharmaceuticals has EBIT of $347 million in 2022.

What is the amount of Pelamed’s interest tax shield in 2022? 52 Quiz 2 Your firm currently has $100 million in debt outstanding with a 10% interest rate. The terms of the loan require the firm to repay $25 million of the balance each year. Suppose that the marginal corporate tax rate is 25%, and that the interest tax shields have the same risk as the loan. What is the present value of the interest tax shields from this debt? 53 Quiz 3 See the attached pdf 54","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
