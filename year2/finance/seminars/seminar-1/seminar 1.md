### Remarks

In 2020, Apple inc. has a board of directors of 6 people, of which 2 were female. As of 2020, the average tenure of a director is approximately 8.2 years. Two directors have a P.h.d however all board members have been to university. 

None of the members of the board were also executives of the company. 


# Question 3 

The consensus provided by Sila, et al. is that the proportion of females on a firm's board is inconsistent with changes in firm risk. 

However the paper noted a level of reverse causality whereby the firm's risk could impact the gender diversity of the board. 

Other social factors also impact the proportion women on the board such as the level of corporate social responsibility that the firm has.
