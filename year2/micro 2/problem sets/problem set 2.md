# Problem Set 2

## Problem 2.1

### a. 
Since Apples are a Giffen good, an increase in the price of apples would decrease the demand for oranges.

### b. 
For WARP to not be violated, if the total cost of the new bundles and prices is greater than the new prices and old prices then the total cost of the old bundles with the old prices then it cannot be true that the total cost of the old bundle with the old prices is greater or equal to the new bundle with the old prices:
$$
\text{if } p'x' \ge p'x \text{ then } px \not\ge px'
$$
| Total Cost | $p$                                          | $p'$                                         |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| $x$        | $$100 \times 100 + 100 \times 100 = 20,000$$ | $$100 \times 100 + 80 \times 100 = 18,000$$ |
| $x'$       | $$100 \times 100 + 100 \times 100 = 20,000$$ |  $$100 \times 100 + 100 \times 100 = 20,000$$                                            |
