# Problem Set 1

## Problem 1.1
Anna's preferences are given by, 
$$\ u(x_{1},x_{2})=x_{1}^{\frac{1}{3}}x_{2}^{\frac{2}{3}} \qquad m = 12,\ p_{1}= 2, \ p_{2}= 1$$
The budget constraint is thus the linear function, 
$$ 2 x_1 + 1 x_2 = 12$$

The marginal utilities are given by the partial derivatives of utility with respect to each good:
$$\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_{1}} = \frac{x_{2}^{\frac{2}{3}}}{3x_{1}^{\frac{2}{3}}} \qquad\qquad \frac{\partial U}{\partial x_{2}} = \frac{2x_{1}^{\frac{1}{3}}}{3x_{2}^{\frac{1}{3}}}$$

The optimal quantities can be obtained through the Lagrangian technique, however the standard solution to the Cobb-Douglas function is: 
$$\frac{p_{1}x_{1}}{a}=\frac{p_{2}x_{2}}{b} \to x_{1}= \frac{ap_{2}x_{2}}{p_{1}b} \quad $$
Substituting parameters:
$$
x_{1}=\frac{ \frac{1}{3}\times 1 \times x_{2}}{2 \times\frac{2}{3}}=\frac{x_{2}}{4}
$$
To obtain optimal quantities we can substitute into the budget constraint: 
$$2\left[\frac{x_{2}}{4}\right]+x_{2}=12 \to x_{2}=6 \qquad  2x_{1}+6=12 \to x_{1}=2$$

Ceteris paribus, a change in the price of good 1 to half of its original price would double the optimal quantityz: 
$$x_{1}= \frac{1}{2}\times \frac{ap_{2}x_{2}}{b} \to 2x_{1}= \frac{ap_{2}x_{2}}{b}$$
