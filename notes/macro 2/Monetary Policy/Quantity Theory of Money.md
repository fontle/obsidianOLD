# Quantity Theory of Money
Is one of the oldest economic theories, it proposes that the nominal output of an economy is equal to the how many times the money supply is exchanged throughout an economy: 

$$PY = MV$$

This relation becomes a theory once the *assumption* that the volatility of money and output is relatively fixed. With this assumption, it was concluded that the price level $(P)$ was mainly influenced by the supply of money $(M)$ and thus inflation was a consequence of actions taken by the central bank. 

However this is not the case, when macroeconomic circumstances change agent's behaviour alters their spending, directly influencing the volatility of money.
