In the past, under classical economic doctrine, monetary policy was thought to be ineffective since the [[quantity theory of money]] proposed that changes in the money supply would only result in inflation. However this dogma has been rejected by empirical evidence suggesting the quantity and price of money does influence the goods market. 

The monetary authority (usually the nation's central bank) can either chose to set the [[money supply targeting|money supply]] or the [[interest rate targeting|interest rate]] but not both at the same time as the quantity and price of money is constrained by money demand in the financial market. The Poole Model can be used to analyse which monetary instrument to use under specific conditions in a closed IS-LM model.
