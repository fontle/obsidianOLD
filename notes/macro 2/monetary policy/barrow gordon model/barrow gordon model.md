## Politicisation of Money Supply


## Mathematics of the Barrow Gordon Model 

The Barrow Gordon model follows the standard model of constrained optimisation: 

The **objective function** is a loss function representing government's preferences: 
$$L^{G}=\lambda \pi ^{2}+ (x-x^{*})^{2}$$
Where by: 
- $L^{G}$ is the welfare loss to the government
- $\pi$ is inflation 
- $x$ is the deviation of output from the natural rate
- $x^{*}$ is the targeted deviation of output from the natural rate
- $\lambda$ is a catchall variable for how responsive the government is to changes in inflation from zero. Or in layman's terms: *"How much the government dislikes inflation"*
