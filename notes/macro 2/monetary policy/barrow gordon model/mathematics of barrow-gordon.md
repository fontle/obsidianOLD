# Mathematics of the Barrow Gordon Model 

### Setup

The Barrow Gordon model follows the standard model of constrained optimisation: 

The **objective function** is a loss function representing government's preferences: 
$$L^{G}=\lambda \pi ^{2}+ (x-x^{*})^{2}$$
Where by: 
- $L^{G}$ is the welfare loss to the government
- $\pi$ is inflation 
- $x$ is the deviation of output from the natural rate
- $x^{*}$ is the targeted deviation of output from the natural rate
- $\lambda$ is a catchall variable for how responsive the government is to changes in inflation from zero. Or in layman's terms: *"How much the government dislikes inflation"*

The **constraint function** is given by an adapted Phillips curve: 
$$x = \alpha(\pi-\pi^{e})$$
Where by: 
- $x$ is the level of output 
- $\alpha$ is the responsiveness of output to deviations in inflation expectation
- $\pi$ is the current time periods inflation
- $\pi^{e}$ is the expected level of inflation in the next time period
