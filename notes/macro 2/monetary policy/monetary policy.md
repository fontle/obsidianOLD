## Classical Monetary Policy
In the past, under classical economic doctrine, monetary policy was thought to be ineffective since the [[quantity theory of money]] proposed that changes in the money supply would only result in inflation. However this dogma has been rejected by empirical evidence suggesting the quantity and price of money does influence the goods market.

## Choice of Policy Instrument
The monetary authority (usually the nation's central bank) can either chose to set the [[money supply targeting|money supply]] or the [[interest rate targeting|interest rate]] but not both at the same time as the quantity and price of money is constrained by money demand in the financial market. The Poole Model can be used to analyse which monetary instrument to use under specific conditions in a closed IS-LM model.

## Politicisation of Monetary Policy
Politicians are democratically accountable however this does not guarantee optimal outcomes for policy:

- Democracy in general is not indicative of optimal policy choices, policy may be: 
	- incompetent
	- incomplete
	- inconsistent
	- susceptible to inflation bias
	- susceptible to electoral volatility
 
Furthermore, in the [[quantity theory of money]], an increase in money supply directly impacts nominal GDP ($PY$) therefore there is a conflict in interest between the common good and the policymakers self interest: 

Since the policymaker could increase the money supply to benefit themselves before it is accounted for by the price level in the economy. This can manifest as corruption in extreme cases however tacitly through **inflation bias**. 

This dichotomy of whether politicians should be in control of monetary policy is considered more in depth in the [[barrow gordon model]].
