1. Money demand volatility refers to how responsive the demand for money is in response to a change in macro circumstance such as a change in interest rates or change in price levels, output etc. Its importance is clear to policymakers as an economy with less money demand volatility would require a lesser adjustment to the interest rate or money supply to achieve the desired output, compared to an economy with greater money demand volatility.

3. As proven in question 2, the variance of output is equal under money supply setting and interest rate setting at $\sigma^{2}$ therefore the central bank under our given assumptions is indifferent to either policy. However, should not reflect the choice of the central bank in reality since a lack of information and or additional objectives of the central bank may sway the preference of monetary instrument towards one policy.
