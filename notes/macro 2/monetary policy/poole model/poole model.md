# The Poole Model

> [!cite] 
> The Poole Model (1970) is used to answer the question of which monetary instrument should the central bank use to manage the economy to **minimise volatility**. 

## Assumptions
A key assumption here is that the central bank's main objective is to minimise volatility. Furthermore the government can only chose **one** of two monetary instruments: setting the [[interest rate targeting|interest rate]], or the [[money supply targeting|money supply]]. 

Another key assumption is that the central bank has **perfect knowledge**, this is not true in reality as macroeconomic indicators are not always reliable and predicting markets is futile. 

Usually, output volatility is different under each regime, and therefore we can determine the macroeconomic scenarios in which each regime is preferable. 

A simple closed IS-LM economy is assumed, with uncertainty in each of the markets using additive random variables $u$ for goods markets and $v$ for financial markets. 

The expected value of each both shocks is 0, implying positive shocks are as probable as negative shocks and the variance is constant and supposedly known. 

## Findings
- If the horizontal displacement of the `LM` curve is greater than the displacement of the **IS** curve, fix the interest rate. 
- If the horizontal displacement of the **IS** curve is greater than the displacement of the `LM` curve, fix the money supply. 

This can be interpreted as if a shock results in a greater impact to the financial market than the goods market, fix the interest rate. If the goods market is impact more than the financial market fix the money supply, and if they are the same then either regime is preferable (however less information is required for interest rate targeting).  

Since it required less information to chose interest rate setting many central banks have moved away from money supply targeting. For example, the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank.
