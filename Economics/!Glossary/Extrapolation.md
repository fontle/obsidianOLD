**Extrapolation** is the process of estimating a value *beyond* the distinct range of a data variable: We assume that the correlation continues past our data set. 

This should only be used if there is both **internal validity** where there is a demonstrated causal relationship within the context of the data and **external validity** where you can generalise the findings of a study to other situations.
