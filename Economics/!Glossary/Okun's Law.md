**Okun's Law** describes the inverse relationship between unemployment and output growth. As unemployment increases, output decreases. 

$$\large
\frac{\bar{Y}-Y}{\bar{Y}}=-\beta(u-\bar{u})
$$

Where: 
- $\bar{Y}$ is the potential GDP
- $Y$ is the actual GDP
- $\beta$ is the responsiveness of growth to changes in unemployment rate
- $u$ is the unemployment rate
- $\bar{u}$ is the natural rate of unemployment
