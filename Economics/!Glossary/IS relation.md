The **IS relation **Equilibrium in the goods market can be described where output $Y$ is equal to the demand for goods $Z$. This is called the [[IS-relation]].

$$ 
\begin{align*}
\text{Goods Demand}:&\\
Z &= C+I+G+NX\\
\text{Equilibrium}:\\

Y &= C(Y,T)_{+,-} + I(Y,i)_{+,-} + \bar{G} 
\end{align*}
$$
