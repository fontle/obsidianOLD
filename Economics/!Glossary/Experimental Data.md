**Experimental Data** is produced by a controlled method of investigating a causal relationship among variables. Researchers create a **control group** and a **treatment group** by randomisation of the independent variable which is under the control of the researcher. 

For example, an experiment on the impact of income relief on poverty could be done by giving a treatment group income relief to a treatment group and nothing to the control group. 

Other examples include the RAND study (1974) which estimated the price elasticity of demand for medical care: It involved 5000 individuals followed for 3 to 5 years which were randomly assigned different insurance schemes to different people to see how much medical care costed impacted consumption.
