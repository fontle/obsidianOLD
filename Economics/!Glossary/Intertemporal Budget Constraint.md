This equation expresses the budget constraint in terms of future value:
$$ \large 
c_{1} + \frac{c_{2}}{1+r}=m_{1}+\frac{m_{2}}{1+r}
$$
We can re-arrange the terms to get in linear form: 
$$ \large
c_{2} = (1+r)m_{1}+m_{2}-(1+r)c_{1}
$$
The **slope of the Budget line** is $-(1+r)$ as represents the *opportunity cost* of consuming today comparative to tomorrow.
