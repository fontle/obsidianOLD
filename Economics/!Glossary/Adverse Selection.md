Is where one party involved in exchange has information about a hidden characteristic regarding the good transacted that is unknown to other parties and takes advantage of this information. This is an example of **asymmetric information**

For example, used-car markets, the dealer has greater information about the health and state of each car, when most buyers do not. Thus the dealers increase the price of crap cars and reduce the price of good cars to distort the price signal of each car and increase overall profit.
