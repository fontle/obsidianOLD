The AD relation shows the relationship between output and money supply, as money supply increases, interest rates decrease, causing investment to increase and output to increase. 

## Closed Economy
$$\large 

Y = Y\left(\overbrace{\frac{M}{P}}^{_\text{Money Supply }}, \underbrace{G}_{_\text{Pub.\ Spend}}, \overbrace{T}^{_{\text{Taxation}}}\right)
$$

## Open Economy
We have to account for fixed exchange rate therefore the relation becomes:

$$\large 
Y = Y(\frac{\bar{E}P}{P*}, G, T)
$$
