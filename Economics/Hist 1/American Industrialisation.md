## Why did America outgrow UK

**Demographics** had a large role in why America outgrew UK rapdily.
- In the 17th century, the population was 5 million, by 1900 it was **100 Million**

## What was the role of slavery in USA industrialisation?

**The New History of Capitalism** argues that the US growth would not have been possible without slavery. However, this book does not supply *quantitative evidence* for this other than descriptive statistics.

The general consensus is that despite slavery created some wealth for some people in the America South, its consequences were overall negative for economic development:
-  It created an institutional framwork for *low public good provision, low trust, unequal wealth, and export oriented*.
- Today, the US south is still the worst performer in terms of education, inequality, urbanisation, sector composition, and discrimination. 

## The US Economy before the civil war

The US econonmy mid 19th century was split in two: 
- **The South** where land and labor intensive production was predominant such as cotton production. 
	- They start exporting cotton to europe: three quarters would go to England, one quarter would go to France.
- **The North** where a rising number of European immigrants and their westward expansion created transport infrastructure, urban hubs, and expanding domestic market for manufactured goods. 
	- A large home market, allows for the adoption of new technology at a faster rate than other economies. 

> The **South** and **North** developed fundamentally different growth strategies. 

### Southern Economy

- Raw material for the European factories was in high demand  
(Heckscher-Ohlin 2 factor-model with only land and labor → US land  
abundant, Western Europe labor abundant)  
-  The climate of the US South joint with the relatively short route to market  
made it ideal location for plantations  
- Slavery provided cheap labor, but also no investment into human capital  
-  Thin planter’s elite lobbied for small tariffs, small state, weak institutions,  
and low public investment (see Engermann and Sokoloff 2000).

### Northern Economy 
- In contrast, North consisted of small family farms producing for the home  
market (see Engermann and Sokoloff 2000)  
- Labor was scarce relative to land  
- → Demand for investment in human capital, e.g. schooling (as the immigrants  
were also used to it from their countries of origin)  
- The availability of land and the promise of a free land attracted millions of  
immigrants from Western Europe  
- This endogenously created two different types of transport infrastructure and  
city networks

*Fogel 1962*  argues that railways were not a necassary condition for US economic growth.
- His study covers a lot of models and is relevant today. He spoke about the east coast which developed a meaningful system of canals by the 19th century where industrialisation occured. 
Meanwhile, *Donaldson and Hornbeck 2016* show with GIS that value of land more than doubled due to railroads. 
*Bleakley and Lin 2012* find that portage sites (where you had to carry your float from one river to another) were the birthplaces for many modern US cities. 

## Chicago Case Study

Chicago acted as a hub connecting the midwest and west coast (thus also europe). One reason for this is an initial advantage, as is good access to both lumber and the Great Plains. 

To take advantage of first nature geography, transport infrastructure needed, as this infrastructure instigates demand and a local market (second nature geography)

Chicago created a mercantile market which is still one of the largest in the world. Which enabled the exchange of commodities between midwest and western America.
