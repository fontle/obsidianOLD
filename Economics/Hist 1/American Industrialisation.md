## Why Did America Outgrow UK

**Demographics** had a large role in why America outgrew UK rapdily.

- In the 17th century, the population was 5 million, by 1900 it was **100 Million**

## What Was the Role of Slavery in USA Industrialisation?
---

**The New History of Capitalism** argues that the US growth would not have been possible without slavery. However, this book does not supply *quantitative evidence* for this other than descriptive statistics.

The general consensus is that despite slavery created some wealth for some people in the America South, its consequences were overall negative for economic development:

- It created an institutional framework for *low public good provision, low trust, unequal wealth, and export oriented*.
- Today, the US south is still the worst performer in terms of education, inequality, urbanisation, sector composition, and discrimination.

## The US Economy before the Civil War
---

The US econonmy mid 19th century was split in two:

- **The South** where land and labor intensive production was predominant such as cotton production.
	- They start exporting cotton to europe: three quarters would go to England, one quarter would go to France.
- **The North** where a rising number of European immigrants and their westward expansion created transport infrastructure, urban hubs, and expanding domestic market for manufactured goods.
	- A large home market, allows for the adoption of new technology at a faster rate than other economies.

> The **South** and **North** developed fundamentally different growth strategies.

### Southern Economy

- Raw material for the European factories was in high demand
(Heckscher-Ohlin 2 factor-model with only land and labor → US land
abundant, Western Europe labor abundant)
- The climate of the US South joint with the relatively short route to market
made it ideal location for plantations
- Slavery provided cheap labor, but also no investment into human capital
- Thin planter’s elite lobbied for small tariffs, small state, weak institutions,
and low public investment (see Engermann and Sokoloff 2000).

### Northern Economy
- In contrast, North consisted of small family farms producing for the home
market (see Engermann and Sokoloff 2000)
- Labor was scarce relative to land
- → Demand for investment in human capital, e.g. schooling (as the immigrants
were also used to it from their countries of origin)
- The availability of land and the promise of a free land attracted millions of
immigrants from Western Europe
- This endogenously created two different types of transport infrastructure and
city networks

## The Grain Invasion in Europe

The Northern and Midwestern states had a productive agriculture but not to the point they could overcome the transport costs Europe. However technological advancements allowed agriculture exports to Europe.

*Fogel 1962* argues that railways were not a necassary condition for US economic growth.

- His study covers a lot of models and is relevant today. He spoke about the east coast which developed a meaningful system of canals by the 19th century where industrialisation occurred.
Meanwhile, *Donaldson and Hornbeck 2016* show with GIS that value of land more than doubled due to railroads.
*Bleakley and Lin 2012* find that portage sites (where you had to carry your float from one river to another) were the birthplaces for many modern US cities.
### Chicago Case Study
---
Chicago acted as a hub connecting the midwest and west coast (thus also europe). One reason for this is an initial advantage, as is good access to both lumber and the Great Plains.

To take advantage of first nature geography, transport infrastructure needed, as this infrastructure instigates demand and a local market (second nature geography)

Chicago created a mercantile market which is still one of the largest in the world. Which enabled the exchange of commodities between midwest and western America.

## The American Model of Prodution
---
The domestic demand for manufactured goods and especially tools for agriculture lead to a new production system. 

### Habbakuk Hypothesis
---
Habbakuk compared relative input conditions into production between America and Britian to explore how it impacted technological advancement. Compared to Britain America was, 
 - Resource Rich    
 - Low Skill Labour 
 - High Wage Demands
 - High agricultural income which led to high wages in urban hubs thus high incentive to substitute capital for labour.
 - Cheap energy (coal, petrol) which allowed for scale of production to increase and enable economies of scale
 - Large population facilitated demand for new goods

### Economies of Scale
---
Mechinisation allowed for cheaper mass production, and allowed America to mass produce goods countries in Europe couldn't such as the automobile. 

Furthermore, America had more homogenous consumer preference which meant that mass produced products could have a greater reach than in European markets.


### Capital Transfer
--- 
In 1870-1914 two thirds of capital exports from London went to America due it being most profitable. 

Consequently, America then had large resources, territory and good institutions which could take advantage of said endowment without funneling resourcs to the few.  

### Mineral Production in America
---
Between 1870 and 1914 America went from a small irrelavent producer to the largest producer of Coal, Copper, Irone Ore, Lead, Petrol, Silver, Sulphur, and Zinc [^1]
Transport innovations were usually a result of natural endowments of certain minerals and resources: Britain was endowed with coal which enabled the railway, America was endowed with petrol which allowed the Automobile.

As a result, the American economy was reliant on the idea that energy was cheap and that resources were widely available.

### 20th century
--- 
Unlike Europe, America was able to develop without major influence from destructive political factors such as the two world wars which enabled America to become the leader in world economically.
