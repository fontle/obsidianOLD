### Growth of Trade
---

International trade is a vital part of globalisation, it grew few a few reasons:

- Advancements in technology 
- Politics (Big and Small) 
- Growth of MNCs
- Spread of liberalism 
- Freight Rates reduced making it cheaper to transport abroad 

### Migration
--- 

Migrants moves because the new territories had **higher land-labour ratios** and so American and Australian workers earned higher wages than their European counterparts. 

There were very few migrants at the time that thought about migrating permanently to new lands as a large proportion of their wage would be sent back to their home nation (roughly a third of migrants to America returned to Europe).

Migration was not set in stone during the 19th century, and was mainly and individual decision. However these microeconomic decision compound themselves into large change within the economy. 

Seasonal Labour was evident in places like western Ireland, where labourers would work in America for 6 months and in Ireland for 6 months

### Convergence
---

- **Wages** (Taylor and Williamson [1997] ) calculated the labour market impacto fm igration in 17 atlantic economices and found that between 1870-1910 and found that real wage dispersion fell by 28% thus showing a convergence in wealth between poorer and richer economies. 
- **Goods** price evidence demonstrated high international integration between Britain and America. Cotton textiles, iron bars, pig iron and copper price fell.
