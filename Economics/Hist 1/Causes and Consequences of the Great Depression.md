## Great Recession vs Great Depression
--- 
In 2008, the world experienced the Global Financial Crisis which was akin to the consequences of the Great Depression.

However, despite calling the GFC the Great Recession, there is unclear comparisons between a recession and depression. The latter experienced great political consequences including the rise of totalitarianism such as that seen in Nazi Germany. The only democracy left in Eastern Europe by 1939 was Czech Republic. 

They way we classify a depression is any decline from peak to trough of a business cycle of more than 10% of GDP counts for a depression, meanwhile a recession means that your GDP declines for two consequative quarters. 

*The definition of recession is relatively soft*, in the sense it is relatively cyclical and part of economic fluctuations. On the other hand, a depression is more structural and usually has greater conseqeuences on the economy. In this sense, the difference between a depression and a recession is a matter of magnitude. 

In the Great Depression there were output losses observed of `30%`. The largest output losses ever recorded in history. 

## Diverging impact of the Great Depression: Britain, America, and Europe

### Britain

The UK was relatively lucky in the sense it received comparatively less decline. This happens when an economy has one of the two conditions: 
1. The economy experienced little growth in the 1920s
	- Countries that experienced, a large boom during the 20s, 'had more to lose' in the sense that they most likely had a positive output gap which made the fall into the great depression more severe. Thus stable or little growth in the 20s allowed such economies to have 'less to lose' and experience a more gentle, yet still severe fall when the great depression occured.
2. They import most there food from abroad
	- If the economy imported food from abroad, a global depression caused import prices to be cheaper, thus enabling economies like Britain to capitalise lost gains in other sectors. 

### Europe 
The Great Depression was seen as the worst development experienced by the United States. On the other hand, the Europeans speak of the Great Depression as causing the emergence of totalitarian regimes rather than the economic consequences of the depression, for example in Adolf Hitler in Germany, and Mousselini in Italy. 

Furthermore, we can see that the depression started at different times, we can think of the Great Depression starting in the United states and transferring across the World.

### America

As we can see in the last three figures, the US stock market is hit especially hard within the span of 3 years, the main market index DOW lost 90% of its value of which it doesn't recover until 1954. 

In the 1930s, America saw the Gold Standard to as a solution to Banking Crisis' whilst nowadays we mainly see them as a major component of the Depression as a whole. 

It took 3 years (until 1933) to fuly realise that monetary standards reform were need in order to restore confidence and stability within the economy. 

Comparatively, in 2008, the first few months looked very similar to the Great Depression in terms of stock market conditions and output changes. In part the reason 2008 had a lesser impact is because of lessons learnt from the 1930s. The federal bank leader in 2008 was Ben Bernanke who was a scholar who head specialised knowledge of the Great Depression and the macro policy mistakes made at the time. 

## Causes of the Great Depression 

What is unique about the Great Depression was not necessarily its causes or the response to the negative shocks but that fact that it lasted a long time after the event. Moreso than negative shocks seen since such as the Great Recession and the prior. It also was a global crisis that impacted a large proportion of the global economy in a number of profound ways. 

Some of the causes of the depression can be highlighted by a few different strands of thinking. To be frank, there is not one single dominant view of the cause of the Great Depression, it seems the magnitude and severity of the crisis was a composite of a few major causes with many minor causes specific to different economies allowing for simultaneous market collapse. The Great Depression conversation is still *academically controversial* with a few main schools of thought: 

### American Histography

Early research on the Great Depression was centred around the United States as it was the main power during the interwar period and afterwards. This could be argued to have created a very US centred perspective. The consequence is that we see a recurring narrative: 

*The Great depression was a fault of the US and they then exported the crisis to the rest of the world.

Even with this premise, academics present an large array of thoughts which stress different factors within American Histography. For example, 
- Monetary policy used by the central bank
- The stock market bubble of the 1920s caused by speculation

### European Histography 

Later research beginning in the 90s in Europe read the American literature and asked whether it fit with the narrative of their home countries and found that GDP figures declines sometimes five to seven quarters before the Great Depression in the United States indicating that other factors were at play. 

Inconsistencies in the premise that the great depression was expected from United States. 

### British Histography 

In Britain, the Great Depression was often referred to as the Great Slump, a much softer narrative to that of America and Europe. However, this seems much more fitting the circumstances of the economy in the 1930s as it was far less pronounced there. 

### An Inconsistent Consensus 

It seems that the constant revisiting of the Great Depression by scholars indicate that the full scope and causes of the Great Depression haven't been fully realised. The complexity of the issue has caused greater debate about its determinants. 

### Agricultural Conditions of the 1920s

In the 1920s and 30s we see a dramatic fall in the price of agriculture. 

In the book *The Grapes of Wrath* by John Steinbeck describes the history of a couple of American farming families who were forced to flee from Oklahoma westward, this narrative of a couple families fits the macroeconomic narrative: 

After World War One, countries were concerned that food imports would pose a food security issue during conflict times and thus started scaling domestic production to become self-sufficient. 

Globally, this created an overproduction of primary resources. 

East Europe and Russian exporters were heavily impacted during World War One, hence we can observe an outsourcing of primary production to neutral countries of the world such as Canada - wheat acreage expanded by 80% under WWI). 

After the World War we see original market players to re-enter the market - yet competitors such as Canada had time to scale production. 

The increased competition drove down international commodity prices as new producers feared crowding out by original players, thus reducing profitability for farmers who owned land, some were driven out causing not only commodity prices but land prices to decline. 

Consequently, primary producing countries really struggled during the 1920s. 

### Unfavourable Labour Market Conditions of the 1920s

In the 1920s the Labour Markets in the industrialised world experienced very high unemployment. 

As a result, this became a political issue and also a cause of economic debate about how persistent unemployment could exist as at the time, the economic narrative (neoclassical) stated only cyclical unemployment was relevant as market forces would adjust conditions back to equilibrium. The main question raised was: 

*"Why do wages not fall in response to persistent unemployment?"*

Research found that during the 1920s there was increased wage rigidity contributing, to unemployment. We have to be careful about making hypothesis with this premise as there is sufficient evidence solely for the United States. 

Wage rigidity becomes a problem when there is a fixed exchange rate as the price level cannot decrease. Consequently, inflation cannot be used to decrease real wages and adjust labour market conditions. Therefore the wage rigidity could have been a cause for the Great Depression as Wage rigidity contributed to very high unemployment. 

In Europe though, we see relatively high/moderate levels of inflation until the mid 1920s. Consequently, many years would be needed before they could retire the gold standard due to the inflationary pressure on the economy caused by World War One. As governments could not fully finance the war efforts through tax increases and borrowing, inflation was a tool used by the governments to pay for the military capital needed to engage in conflict. The impacts of such money creation weren't realised properly until the 1920s as price controls were used extensively for necessities during the war.

Usually, in the presence of high inflation, wage rigidity is not an issue as the real value of wages decreases thus counterbalances downward pressures on labour. 

Therefore we can assume that wage rigidity is less of an impact for Europe as it is for America, who not only had lower inflation due to less engagement in the war. 

### Unbalanced Economic Growth and Changed Consumer Baskets

In the 1920s there was a lack of diversification in the American economy, prosperity had become dependent on a few industries such as construction and automobiles. 

By 1929, these industries began to decline as they could not scale indefinitely in the USA. These industries couldn't scale properly in Europe as they were limited to a smaller class of individuals meanwhile America had a larger middle class which could sustain automobile expenditure. Furthermore between 1926-29, expenditure on construction dropped from 11 billion to 9 billion. 

The simultaneous decline of these industries, meant that other sectors could not take up the slack, and economic growth in the US became inherently fragile and unstable. 

Consumer preferences lasted to consumer durables such as motor vehicles furniture, appliances, radios etc. Meant that a large proportion of the economy relied on expenditure on these items that were not necessarily necessities to the average American. Thus when economic decline occurred, consumers stopped or delayed the purchasing of these goods and appeasing the poorer quality of their current ones. Therefore, the durables industries that the economy relied on became vulnerable to cyclical instability. 

*Food lasts a week, machines last years.*

Consequently the business cycle downturn reinforced itself within the United States.

### European Reconstruction Efforts

European reconstruction efforts after World War I contributed to the Great Depression in a number of ways:

1. **Debt**: The reconstruction efforts required vast amounts of money, and many European countries borrowed heavily from the United States to finance their rebuilding. By 1929, European countries owed around $10 billion to the US, which was a significant amount of money at the time. When the stock market crashed in 1929, US investors pulled their money out of Europe, leaving the continent with a severe shortage of funds. This made it difficult for European countries to pay back their debts, which further weakened their economies.
2. **Trade**: European reconstruction efforts created a demand for raw materials and other goods, which the US supplied. However, as the European economies weakened, demand for US goods declined. This led to a decline in US exports, which hurt the US economy.
3. **Currency**: To pay for their reconstruction efforts, many European countries devalued their currencies. This made their exports cheaper, which hurt US businesses that were trying to sell their goods overseas.
4. **Protectionism**: To protect their own economies, many countries imposed high tariffs on imported goods. This led to a decrease in international trade, which further hurt the global economy.

Overall, European reconstruction efforts were not the sole cause of the Great Depression, but they were a contributing factor. The heavy borrowing, decline in demand for US goods, devaluation of currencies, and protectionist policies all played a role in the economic downturn that followed.

#### The Dawes Plan

After WW1, a system known as the *Dawes plan* was created. It was a financial agreement between the US, Germany, and the Allied Powers which provided loans to Germany which in turn paid reparations to the Allied Powers for the damage caused during the war. 

In turn, some of the reparation payments were sent back to the United States to pay off loans Allied powers took out to fund military efforts. 

This created a *circular flow of money* between the three parties and helped stabilise the European economy in the 1920s, whilst also allowing Germany to rebuild its economy after the war. 

However, this reliance on loans and reparations created a **cycle of debt** which was not sustainable. Furthermore, global economic downturn (in part due to lowered agriculture costs, wage rigidity, etc.) forced a devaluation which made it harder to pay these loans and catalysed the occurrence of The Great Depression.

It could be argued that short-sightedness by politicians and a focus on political integration of Europe was prioritised over sound macroeconomic policy.
