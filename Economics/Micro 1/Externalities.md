[[Externalities]] are situations in which the welfare of a primary agent is directly effected by the actions of a second agent. There is no market to evaluate this effect and internalise the consequences of the second agents actions.

There are two ways to characterise externalities:
- Positive vs Negative
- Consumption vs Production

## Examples of Externalities
---
|             | Positive   | Negative |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Consumption | Education           | Alcohol and Smoking         |
| Production  | Beekeeping | Pollution         |

## Modelling Externalities
---
We can supplement a market's supply and demand functions to include the **social cost** which is equal to the private cost on the primary agent and the secondary costs on others. Which creates *two supply curves*. Furthermore, we can include the social benefit of a good which includes the private utility captured by the demand function and the secondary benefits. 

## Methods to Internalise Externalities
---
1. Emissions standards: 
	- Impose the market produces no more than the socially optimal level of output
	- Or, impose the firms do not produce more than the optimal level of pollution
	- The choice between the two depends on the information the government has.
2. Taxes and Subsidies for negative and positive externalities respectively as they can change the market price to the socially
## The Coase Theorem
---
If property rights are well-defined and there are no transaction costs, then economic agents will contract to achive an efficient outcome, irrespective of the assignment of property rights.
