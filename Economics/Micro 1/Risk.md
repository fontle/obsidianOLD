## Lotteries
---
Lotteries describe risky alternatives, and specifies each possible outcome of the risky alternatives it represents, and the probability that this outcome will occur. 

### Expected Value
---
$$\large
EV = \pi_{1}c_{1}+\pi_{2}c_2
$$
This represents how much on average a lottery will return, if you remember from probability, that this is the same as the expcected value of a random variable: 
$$\large
EV = E[X] = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}x \cdot P(X_{i}=x)
$$
### Expected Utility 
---
$$\large
u(c_{1}, c_{2}, \pi_{1}, \pi_{2}) = \pi_{1} v(c_{1})+ \pi_{2}v(c_{2}) 
$$
This represents the average utility the lottery will return, where $v(c)$ is the risk function. 

### Compound Lottery 
---
$$\large 
L_{3} = [L_{1}, L_{2};\alpha, 1- \alpha]
$$
Compound Lottery are ones where the outcomes are other lotteries, In this case, probability $L_3$ returns lottery $L_{1}$ is $\alpha$ whilst the probability that $L_{3}$ returns lottery $L_{2}$ is $1-\alpha$. 


## States of Nature 
---

Whether an outcome is realised depends on the *state of nature* that will occur. Therefore lotteries can also be used to represent the *contingent consumption plans* of an individual, ie. what will be consumed in each state of nature
