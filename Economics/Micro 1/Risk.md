## Lotteries
---

Lotteries describe risky alternatives, and specifies each possible outcome of the risky alternatives it represents, and the probability that this outcome will occur:

> [!example]
> A consumer can make a risky investment which will provide no return half of the time, and a $4\$$ return the other half of the time.
>
> This investment can be represented by a a lottery with two outcomes where each outcome occurs 50% of the time.

## States of Nature 
---

Whether an outcome is realised depends on the *state of nature* that will occur. Therefore lotteries can also be used to represent the *contingent consumption plans* of an individual, ie. what will be consumed in each state of nature
