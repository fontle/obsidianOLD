The two main characteristics of public goods: 

**Non-Excludability** and **Non Rivalry**. It means that the goods consumption is allowed for everyone freely and also one person's consumption cannot reduce the availability for others. 

|                | Rival        | Non Rival   |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Excludable     | Private Good | Club Good   |
| Non Excludable | Common Good  | Public Good |

An example of a public good is a park since no one can be prevented from using it and me walking in the park does not hinder another's ability to walk in hte park.

### Modelling Public Goods
--- 
Our economy has two consumers $A,B$, and a public good that costs $c$. The reservation prices are $r_{A}$ and $r_{B}$ respectively which are the maximum money that $A$ and $B$ are willing to pay to have the public good available respectively. 

We can have a **payment schedule** which specifies how much money each consumer will contribute: 
$$g_{A} + g_{B} \ge c$$
The purchasing of the public good is a Pareto improvement if $r_{i} > g_{i}$ for both consumers. A payment scheme is a pareto improvement if $r_{A} + r_{B} > c$

### The Free Rider Problem 
---
The **Free Rider Problem** is a type of market failure that occurs when communal or public goods are consumed by agents who do not contribute or underpay for their use.

### Example 
| $A / B$   | Buy      | Don't Buy |
| --------- | -------- | --------- |
| Buy       | -50, -50 | -50,100   |
| Don't Buy | 100,-50  | 0,0       |

In this case the nash equilibrium is not to buy the public good as regardless of the other agent, the best option for each agent is not to puchase the good. 

This is the very definition of free-riding as it is better off for the consumer to not purchase the good.
### Solutions 
1. Government Provision
2. Voting
3. Auctions 

### Tragedy of the Commons
