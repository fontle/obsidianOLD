## Assumptions
---
In this model, we assume that the consumer starts with some level of icome, that they receive whether they work or not. This is equal to amount $M$ and is called *non-labour income*. 

The consumer decides to use some of his income to consume goods of amount $C$, at price $p$. 

In this model $M$ is not the only source of income. The consumer can decide to supply $L$ hours of work, with a wage rate of $w$.

It is also likely that there is a maximum number of hours that a worker can provide. We can denote this number of hours as $\bar{L}$.

## Budget Constraint
--- 
We can derive a budget constraint for this model: 

$$\large
pC+w(\bar{L}-L) =M + w\bar{L}
$$Which re-arranged to a linear funciton is 
$$C = \frac{M + w\bar{L}}{P}-\frac{w}{P}R$$
Whereby: 
- $pC$ is aggregate value of consumption
- $\bar{L}-L$ is the hours of leisure which is equal to rest $R$
- $w \bar{L}$ is the maximum wage they can receive

### Endowment
For an individual's labour supply, the endowment point is where $R= \bar{L}$.

### Income and Substitution Effect
We can determine that the price of leisure $(\bar{L} - L)$ is the wage,$w$, this means that there is a **substitution effect** as when wages increase we will likely *reduce* our "consumption" of labour. However, if this was the only effect then we would determine that a high wage would result in people to not work? This assumption is wrong.

When wages change, there is another effect ocurring on the other side the equation. $w\bar{L}$. As wages increase, the possible wage for the individual increases and therefore their 'budget' for work is higher, and thus the worker works more. This is known as the **income effect**.

## Optimal Choice
---
The optimal choice occurs where the marginal rate of substitution is equal to the slope of the budget line.
