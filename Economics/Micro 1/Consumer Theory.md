## Bundles
---

$$ (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) $$

Shows $n$ different goods that can be consumer and $x_i$ quantity of the good $i$ in the bundle. For the moment our analysis will consist of only bundles with **two goods.**

## [[Budget Line|Budget Constraint]] 
---
$$ p_1x_1+p_2x_2\le m $$

Means that the amount that I spend on each good $p_nx_n$ can only be less or equal than the amount of money that I have $m$

## [[Budget Line]]
---

$$ x_2={m \over p_2} - {p_1 \over p_2}x_1 $$

Shows graphically the limits of which bundles I can own. The gradient represents the price ratio between the two goods.

## Preferences
---

We usually make the following assumption on preferences:

1.  **Completeness**: consumers have an opinion of everything and can rank preferences between goods
2.  **Reflexivity**
3.  **Transitivity**: It means that people have consistent preferences, if $a>b$ and $b>c$ then $a > c$

## Well-Behaved Preferences
---

1.  **Monotonicity** We assume the consumer will always prefer more goods, there is no satiable level.
2.  **Convexity** We assume the consumer prefers a mix of the goods rather than just one of the goods

## Indifference Curves

---

Is a curve that represents all the different preference bundles that the consumer is indifferent to: i.e. each bundle along the indifference curve provides that same utility to the consumer.

How does the indifference curve link to our preference assumptions?

-   Bundles father from the origin are preferred to those on indifference close to the origin due to monotonicity
-   Indifference curves slope downward due to monotonicity
-   Indifference curves cannot cross due to transitivity
-   Indifference curves are convex due to convexity

## Utility Functions
---

Are simple ways to summarise preferences. It assigns a value of satisfaction to bundles so that more preferred bundles get higher values.

We derive the indifference curve by finding all the bundles that give the same utility level. Therefore we find all bundles $(x_1, x_2)$ such that:

$$ u(x_1,x_2) =u^* $$

## Marginal Rate of Substitution
---
$$ \frac{dx_2}{dx_1}=-\frac{MU_1(x_1,x_2)}{MU_2(x_1,x_2)} $$

The slope of the indifference curve is the marginal rate of substitution.

## Optimal Choice
---
The optimal bundle for the consumer where utility is maximised and within the budget constraint is given by the point where the marginal rate of substitution is equal to the gradient of the budget constraint:
$$ \frac{MU(x_2)}{MU(x_1)} = -{p_2 \over p_1} $$

It must also conform to the budget constraint:
$$ p_1x_1+p_2x_2=m $$

## The Engel Curve
---
We can use the expansion path to map the optimal quantities of a given good for different levels of income. This give the **Engel curve** for a single good.
