The change in capital over a period of time $t$ can be given by: 
$$\large
\begin{matrix}
\frac{K_{t+1}}{N}-\frac{K_{t}}{N}&=&s\frac{f(K_{t})}{N}&- &\delta\frac{ (K_{t})}{N}\\
_{\text{change in capital}}& & _{\text{investment}}&& _{\text{depreciation of K}} \\
\end{matrix}
$$
This shows that changes in capital per worker is the difference between investment per worker (which is a function of the savings rate) and the depreciation of capital (described by the coefficient $\delta$)

As investment per workers increases, fundamentally as a result of an increase in the savings rates it shift the investment curve upwards thus moving the equilibrium point  between investment and depreciation, as a result the overall output per worker.

## How does the saving rate affect the growth rate of output per worker? 
1. *The saving rate has no effect on the long-run growth rate of output per worker which is equal to zero because the economy will converge to a **constant** level of output per worker*

In order to create sustained positive growth, capital worker would have to increase. In the case of decreasing returns to capital, capital accumulation would need to be greater than the output of the economy itself in order to create sustained growth. Thus, technological progress is needed in order to improve the quality of capital and  as a result improve the returns to capital. 

2. *Nevertheless, the saving rate determines the output per worker in the long run.*

Ceteris Paribus. Countries with a higher saving rate will achieve higher output per worker in the long run. **NOTE: this is different from the first statement which states saving rate has no affect on growth**. 

3. *An increase in the saving rate will lead to higher growth of output per worker for some time, but not for ever*

As output per worker increase in the long run due to an increase the saving rate as presumed by point 2, the economy will go through a *period* of positive growth. This period of growth will end once the economy reaches a steady state. 

## Introducing Human Capital 
---
Thus far we have only accounted for physical capital without accounting for human capital, however this is not realistic as output per worker strongly correlates with human capital:

Therefore we should adjust our capital acummulation relation to:
$$\frac{Y}{N} = f\left( \frac{K}{N}, \frac{H}{N} \right)$$
An increase in how much the society saves in the form of human capital - through education and training - increases the human capital per worker, thus increasing overall output per worker. 

In long run, output per worker depends not only on how much it saces but also on how much it spends on education. 

There is roughly equal weighting on important between physical and human capital per worker. 

In the United States, spending on education is about 4% of GDP compared to 17% investment in physical capital. 

## Technological progress
--- 
Technological progress reduces the number of workers needed to achieve a given amount of output.
j
Thus technologyical progress increases $AN$ which we can think of as the amount of *effective labour* with constant returns to scale: 
$$
\begin{align}
2Y &= f(2K,2AN) \\
&\text{or in general} \\
xY &= f(xK,xAN)
\end{align}
$$
Technological progress has a similar effect to increasing the number of workers. 

As a result we can update our model to include not only population growth and depreciation but also technological progress: 
$$\left(\frac{s}{\delta + g_{N} + g_{A}}\right)^{2}= \frac{K*}{AN}$$
## Charactaristics of long term
---
- Capital per effective worker and output per effective worker are constant  
-  Capital per effective worker and output per effective worker are constant.  
- Equivalently, capital per worker and output per worker are growing at the rate  of technological progress, gA.  
- Equivalently, capital and output are growing at a rate equal to the sum of  population growth and the rate of technological progress, (gA + gN).  
- This situation is referred to as the balanzced growth path. All variables grow at  the same rate (if measured in the same units!!)  
- Growth rates on the balanced growth path are independent of the savings rate
## Determinants of Techonological Progress
---
Technological progresss in economics is the result of firms' research activities. The outcome of R&D is *idead*. These are non-rival.

Spending on R&D depend on : 
- The **fertility** of the research process or how spending on research translates into ideas and innovation itself. This ca be broken down to: 
	- The interaction of basic and applied research. 
	- Some countries are more successfull at basic reasearch whilst others at applied.
	- It also takes **time**, sometimes decades for the full potential of discoveries to be realised.
- The **appropriability of research** or how able firms are to reap the benefits of R&D.
	- Is there a payoff in being first at developing a new product? how strong is patent protection in the economy. 

### Patents

| Positives                                                               | Negatives                                              |     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --- |
| - Increase in expected profits from R&D.                                | - Could create a monopoly                              |     |
| - Patents are temporary, afterwards the technology is readily available | - Granting a patent is expensive and costly            |     |
|                                                                         | - Diverts resources to law suits instead of innovation |     |
|                                                                         | May prevent progress                                   |     |
