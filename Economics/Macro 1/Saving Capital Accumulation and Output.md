The change in capital over a period of time $t$ can be given by: 
$$\large
\begin{matrix}
\frac{K_{t+1}}{N}-\frac{K_{t}}{N}&=&s\frac{f(K_{t})}{N}&- &\delta\frac{ (K_{t})}{N}\\
_{\text{change in capital}}& & _{\text{investment}}&& _{\text{depreciation of K}} \\
\end{matrix}
$$
This shows that changes in capital per worker is the difference between investment per worker (which is a function of the savings rate) and the depreciation of capital (described by the coefficient $\delta$)

As investment per workers increases, fundamentally as a result of an increase in the savings rates it shift the investment curve upwards thus moving the equilibrium point  between investment and depreciation, as a result the overall output per worker.

## How does the saving rate affect the growth rate of output per worker? 
1. *The saving rate has no effect on the long-run growth rate of output per worker which is equal to zero because the economy will converge to a **constant** level of output per worker*

In order to create sustained positive growth, capital worker would have to increase. In the case of decreasing returns to capital, capital accumulation would need to be greater than the output of the economy itself in order to create sustained growth. Thus, technological progress is needed in order to improve the quality of capital and  as a result improve the returns to capital. 

2. *Nevertheless, the saving rate determines the output per worker in the long run.*

Ceteris Paribus. Countries with a higher saving rate will achieve higher output per worker in the long run. **NOTE: this is different from the first statement which states saving rate has no affect on growth**. 

3. *An increase in the saving rate will lead to higher growth of output per worker for some time, but not for ever*

As output per worker increase in the long run due to an increase the saving rate as presumed by point 2, the economy will go through a *period* of positive growth. This period of growth will end once the economy reaches a steady state. 

## Introducing Human Capital 
---
Thus far we have only accounted for physical capital without accounting for human capital, however this is not realistic as output per worker strongly correlates with human capital: 
![[Pasted image 20230220171201.png]]

Therefore we should adjust our capital acummulation relation to:
$$\frac{Y}{N} = f\left( \frac{K}{N}, \frac{H}{N} \right)$$
An increase in how much the society saves in the form of human capital - through education and training - increases the human capital per worker, thus increasing overall output per worker. 

In long run, output per worker depends not only on how much it saces but also on how much it spends on education. 

There is roughly equal weighting on important between physical and human capital per worker. 

In the United States, spending on education is about 4% of GDP compared to 17% investment in physical capital. 

## Technological progress
--- 
Technological progress reduces the number of workers needed to achieve a given amount of output.
j
Thus technologyical progress increases $AN$ which we can think of as the amount of *effective labour* with constant returns to scale: 
$$
\begin{align}
2Y &= f(2K,2AN) \\
&\text{or in general} \\
xY &= f(xK,xAN)
\end{align}
$$
Technological progress has a similar effect to increasing the number of workers. 

As a result we can update our model to include not only population growth and depreciation but also technological progress: 
$$\left(\frac{s}{\delta + g_{N} + g_{A}}\right)^{2}= \frac{K*}{AN}$$
