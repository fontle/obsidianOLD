The change in capital over a period of time $t$ can be given by: 
$$\large
\begin{matrix}
\frac{K_{t+1}}{N}-\frac{K_{t}}{N}&=&s\frac{f(K_{t})}{N}&- &\delta\frac{ (K_{t})}{N}\\
_{\text{change in capital}}& & _{\text{investment}}&& _{\text{depreciation of K}} \\
\end{matrix}
$$
This shows that changes in capital per worker is the difference between investment per worker (which is a function of the savings rate) and the depreciation of capital (described by the coefficient $\delta$)

As investment per workers increases, fundamentally as a result of an increase in the savings rates it shift the investment curve upwards thus moving the equilibrium point  between investment and depreciation, as a result the overall output per worker.

## How does the saving rate affect the growth rate of output per worker? 
1. *The saving rate has no effect on the long-run growth rate of output per worker which is equal to zero because the economy will converge to a **constant** level of output per worker*

In order to create sustained positive growth, capital worker would have to increase. In the case of decreasing returns to capital, capital accumulation would need to be greater than the output of the economy itself in order to create sustained growth. Thus, technological progress is needed in order to improve the quality of capital and  as a result improve the returns to capital. 

2. *Nevertheless, the saving rate determines the output per worker in the long run.*

Ceteris Paribus. Countries with a higher saving rate will achieve higher output per worker in the long run. **NOTE: this is different from the first statement which states saving rate has no affect on growth**. 

3. *An increase in the saving rate will lead to higher growth of output per worker for some time, but not for ever*

As output per worker increase in the long run due to an increase the saving rate as presumed by point 2, the economy will go through a *period* of positive growth. This period of growth will end once the economy reaches a steady state.
