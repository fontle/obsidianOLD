## Question One: A

## Question Two: C

## Question Three: C

## Question Four
---

$\text{Profit} = 2m -1.3m +3m - 3.2m =0.5m$
$\text{Salaries} = 1m + 0.8m = 1.8m$
$\text{Taxation} = 0.2m + 0.4m = 0.6m$
$\text{Output}= 3.8m+2m= 5.8m$ 
$\text{Expenditure}= 3m$ 
$\text{Interest} = 0.2m$
$\text{Transfers} = 2m$
$\text{Inventory} = 0.8$

### Income Method
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{GDP} &= \text{National Income + Taxation}\\
&= 1.8 + 0.8 + 0.5 + 0.2 + 0.5 \\
&= 3.8 m 
\end{align*}
$$

### Expenditure Method
$$\begin{align*}
\text{GDP} &= C + I + G + NX\\
&= 3 + 0.8 + 0 + 0 \\
&= 3.8
\end{align*}$$
### Product Method
$$

\begin{align*}
\text{GDP} &= \text{Gross Output} - \text{Intermediate Consumption}\\
&= 5.8 -2\\
&= 3.8
\end{align*}

## Question 5
--- 
Gross private domestic investment = 40
-  Government purchases of goods and services = 30
-  Gross National Product (GNP) = 200
-  Net exports (exports â€“ imports) = -18
-  Taxes = 60
-  Government transfer payments to domestic private sector = 25
-  Interest payments from the government to the domestic private sector = 15 (assume all interest payments by the government go to domestic households)
- Factor income received from the rest of the world = 7
- Factor income paid to rest of world = 9
- Government investment = 0
$$

\text{Aggregate Consumption} =15 + 30+ 7 - 9 = 43

$$
## Question 6
---
$\text{GNP = GDP + Income overseas - Foreign investment}$
$\text{GDP = GNP - Income overseas + Foreign investment }$
$\text{GDP = 200 - 7 + 9 = 202}$

## Question 7
---
Weighting each index to their respective weights: 
$1.04\times 0.6 + 1.01 \times 0.2 + 1.02 \times 0.2 =1.03 \therefore 3\text{ \%CPI inflation}$ 
## Question 8
---

## Question 9
---
$1\times1.02^{10}= 1.21899\ldots \approx 1.219 \therefore\ \text{D.}$ 
## Question 10
---
### A.
	Consumption should be the major component since that is the highest proportion of GDP. 
### B.
	Real GDP is a poor measure of economic performance as it does not account for population changes or how the money is distributed in society. A larger value of output does not necassarily indicate that those resources are allocated optimally in the economy.
