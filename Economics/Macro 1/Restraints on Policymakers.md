## Lack of Information
--- 
Macroeconomists are like doctors treating cancer, there is a lot they know, but also a lot they don't know. 

When trying to achieve an objective, macroeconomists use (perhaps rely) on macroeconometric modules which assume the output of a given policy decision based on parameters about the economy. However, the uncertainty in these models can be high, with different models predicting vastly different consequences of a policy decision. 

| Year | Model 1 | 2     | 3     | 4     |
| ---- | ------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1    | -0.19   | -0.20 | -0.16 | -0.57 |
| 2    | -0.3    | -0.14 | -0.22 | -0.1  |
| 3    | -0.28   | -0.02 | -0.04 | -0.02 |

For example in the table above, shows the response of output to a monetary shock. 

Each model has different dynamics: Model 4 has a very large initial shock with a fast return to equilibrium levels, whilst model 1 predicts a small shock initialy and an increase in the medium run to 0.3 in year then levels out beyond 3 years. 

As shown, the range of these models is vast, even if you can model the mistakes, there is a lot of uncertainty in the models, and thus policymakers should act cautiously. 

### Uncertainty and Policy
If there is large uncertainty in the models considered in policymaking, then the less active policy regulators should make. The fundamental aim of policy should be to **avoid prolonged recessions**, slowing down booms, and avoiding inflationary pressures. 

The close the economy is to a recession, or if it they are in a recession, then the government should undertake more active policies to pursue these objectives. These conclusions would have been controversial 30 years ago: 
## Paradigm Shift: Optimal Control Theory to Game Theory 
--- 
30 years ago, the main school of macro policy was optimal control theory which assumed the economy to be a somewhat determinant *machine* whereby policy could be used to achieve desired equilibria and outcomes. However, this often led to an over reliance in econometric models that predicted outcomes and fine-tuning to said models. 

Recently, a more modern approach involving game theory must considered. The economy consists of agents that predict future states of the economy and thus, expectations play an important role in determining inflation, recall the inflation identity: 
$$
\pi = \pi^{e}- \alpha(u - u_{n})
$$
Price expectation are a fundamental part of inflation. As a consequence understanding the interactions between government policy changes and the expecations of firms and consumers is vital to choosing effective measures. 

To understand the implication of this premise we can analyse a hostage taking situation: 

#### Hostage Taking and Negotiation
Most governments have stated policy that they will not negotiate with hostage takers. This is to *deter hostage taking in the first place*. 

However, suppose that despite the policy, a hostage taking occurs, the best course of action is to negotiate to limit the damage of the situation itself.

Thus, the states policy would be ineffective. Hostage takers, would go off the expected action of the policy maker rather than the stated one, thus making the stated policy redundant. 

Applying this to real life, suppose a central bank has a target unemployment rate equal to the natural rate: 
$$u = u_{n}$$
The central bank faces following relation: 
$$\pi=-\alpha(u-u_{n})$$
If the central bank follows with its stated policy, inflation will be equal to zero, the central banks stated policy aligns with expectations. 

However, if the government allows an inflation rate of 1%, and alpha is close to one,  the government can trade 1% inflation for a 1% reduction in unemployment. If the central bank finds this trade off to be attractive, they reduce unemployment by 1% and increase inflation by 1%, **deviating from their expected policy.**

Since the central bank has increased money more than it initially announced, wage setters may expect a 1% increase in inflation. Therefore in order to retain the reduction in unemployment the central bank must accept 2% inflation. If wage setters observe this 2% increase, then they are like to increase the expectations further. A spiral may incur. 

The final outcome: Much higher inflation. If the central bank stuck with its stated policy, they could have achieved the same unemployment rate with much better inflation, but instead, there is a small reduction in unemployment with a much larger increase in inflation. 

### Credibility and Deviation
To prevent central banks from deviating from the announced policy they must be credible. 

There are a few ways to do this: 
- Strip the policy making power of the central bank, or restrict it 
- Make the central bank independent to try and reduce political influence
- Incentivise central bankers to look at the long run and less so the short run. 

## Political Influence
--- 
If voters are short sighted, the temptation for politicians to provide short term gain via cutting taxes, reducing interest rates, etcetera may prove irresistable. 

Thus, we might expect a political business cycle with higher growth on average before elctions than after elections.

In the UK, there is little evidence of this type of maniupulation, with long run trends that are not parallel to political cycles. 

In contrary, in Mexico, there is large fluctuations in GDP close to elections, therefore indicating that political institutions are combined with monetary policy to retain power.
