## Lack of Information
--- 
Macroeconomics are like doctors treating cancer, there is a lot they know, but also a lot they don't know. 

When trying to achieve an objective, macro-economists use (perhaps rely) on macro-econometric modules which assume the output of a given policy decision based on parameters about the economy. However, the uncertainty in these models can be high, with different models predicting vastly different consequences of a policy decision. 

| Year | Model 1 | 2     | 3     | 4     |
| ---- | ------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1    | -0.19   | -0.20 | -0.16 | -0.57 |
| 2    | -0.3    | -0.14 | -0.22 | -0.1  |
| 3    | -0.28   | -0.02 | -0.04 | -0.02 |

For example in the table above, shows the response of output to a monetary shock. 

Each model has different dynamics: Model 4 has a very large initial shock with a fast return to equilibrium levels, whilst model 1 predicts a small shock initially and an increase in the medium run to 0.3 in year then levels out beyond 3 years. 

As shown, the range of these models is vast, even if you can model the mistakes, there is a lot of uncertainty in the models, and thus policymakers should act cautiously. 

### Uncertainty and Policy
If there is large uncertainty in the models considered in policy-making, then the less active policy regulators should make. The fundamental aim of policy should be to **avoid prolonged recessions**, slowing down booms, and avoiding inflationary pressures. 

The close the economy is to a recession, or if it they are in a recession, then the government should undertake more active policies to pursue these objectives. These conclusions would have been controversial 30 years ago: 
## Paradigm Shift: Optimal Control Theory to Game Theory 
--- 
30 years ago, the main school of macro policy was optimal control theory which assumed the economy to be a somewhat determinant *machine* whereby policy could be used to achieve desired equilibrium and outcomes. However, this often led to an over reliance in econometric models that predicted outcomes and fine-tuning to said models. 

Recently, a more modern approach involving game theory must considered. The economy consists of agents that predict future states of the economy and thus, expectations play an important role in determining inflation, recall the inflation identity: 

$$
\pi = \pi^{e}- \alpha(u - u_{n})
$$

Price expectation are a fundamental part of inflation. As a consequence understanding the interactions between government policy changes and the expecations of firms and consumers is vital to choosing effective measures. 

To understand the implication of this premise we can analyse a hostage taking situation: 

#### Hostage Taking and Negotiation
Most governments have stated policy that they will not negotiate with hostage takers. This is to *deter hostage taking in the first place*. 

However, suppose that despite the policy, a hostage taking occurs, the best course of action is to negotiate to limit the damage of the situation itself.

Thus, the states policy would be ineffective. Hostage takers, would go off the expected action of the policy maker rather than the stated one, thus making the stated policy redundant. 

Applying this to real life, suppose a central bank has a target unemployment rate equal to the natural rate: 

$$u = u_{n}$$

The central bank faces following relation: 

$$\pi=-\alpha(u-u_{n})$$

If the central bank follows with its stated policy, inflation will be equal to zero, the central banks stated policy aligns with expectations. 

However, if the government allows an inflation rate of 1%, and alpha is close to one,  the government can trade 1% inflation for a 1% reduction in unemployment. If the central bank finds this trade off to be attractive, they reduce unemployment by 1% and increase inflation by 1%, **deviating from their expected policy.**

Since the central bank has increased money more than it initially announced, wage setters may expect a 1% increase in inflation. Therefore in order to retain the reduction in unemployment the central bank must accept 2% inflation. If wage setters observe this 2% increase, then they are like to increase the expectations further. A spiral may incur. 

The final outcome: Much higher inflation. If the central bank stuck with its stated policy, they could have achieved the same unemployment rate with much better inflation, but instead, there is a small reduction in unemployment with a much larger increase in inflation. 

### Credibility and Deviation
To prevent central banks from deviating from the announced policy they must be credible. 

There are a few ways to do this: 
- Strip the policy making power of the central bank, or restrict it 
- Make the central bank independent to try and reduce political influence
- Incentivise central bankers to look at the long run and less so the short run. 

## Political Influence

It is often that politics has a grip on policymakers' decisions. Because of this, policymakers often exchange long term benefits short term ones that look great to voters to increase the odds of re-election. As if a politicians aim is to get elected by pleasing voters, short term gain seems to be the only thing to play for. 

Furthermore, the short-sightedness of voters allow politicians to exploit human nature by pandering to voters now to make them forget past mistakes.

If this occurs, we would expect a clear **political business cycle** whereby fluctuations and output coincide in parallel to elections. 

In the UK, such cycle doesn't seem to be apparent, and macroeconomic circumstance is more of a product of composite indicators as expected. However, in Mexico, output seems to coincide with elections, implying that policymaking institutions are acting  more under political influence rather than sound economic reasoning:

### Internal Games

Another reason to restraint policymakers is that they may play games amongst themselves by, for example, delaying decisions that would bring the opposition great benefit, hoping that the other party will make adjustments and take the blame. In this case, better ways of designing the legislature process would improve macroeconomic outcomes by increasing both the responsiveness and accountability of parliament.

### Optimal Inflation Rate

Some economists argue about the optimal rate of inflation:
- Some economists aim for *low positive inflation* such as the 2% target imposed by the Bank of England. This is because inflation can be utilised as a tool to control inflation, as central banks can trade of inflation for unemployment according to the Philips relation 
- Alternatively, some aim for price stability, that is 0% inflation. This reduces the impact of some costs of inflation such as Money Illusion. They argue, that the central bank can achieve greater credibility and simplicity when aiming for 0% inflation which may help with expectations of firms and consumers.

### Costs of Inflation 
---

#### Shoe Leather Costs 

In the medium run, a higher inflation rate leads to a higher nominal interest rate and so a greater opportunity cost of holding money. As a result, people decrease their money balances by making more trips to the bank, these trips would be avoided if inflation were lower and people could be doing other things instead, such as working or leisure time. 

#### Tax Distortions

When inflation occurs, the prices of everything increases, including wages. As a result, if tax brackets are not synchronised with inflation, more individuals are put in higher tax brackets in a phenomenon called *bracket creep*. Consequently, not only does the real value of income go down due to inflation, but also due to an increase in taxes reducing spending power further.

#### Money Illusion 

Humans are irrational. Practically everyone uses nominal price changes as a basis for  changes in value over time, however this not actually indicative of the real price of the product. For example, you may often hear a grandparent say *"back in my day milk only cost 35 cents!"* blah blah blah. This is nonsense economically as inflation *back in their day* is not accounted for. This phenomenon is called Money Illusion whereby people find it difficult to respond to price signals when they are all changing simultaneously due to inflation. As a consequence, even if labour receives higher wages parallel to good price increases (thus the proportion of income a good is stays the same) the individual may say that it *feels* more expensive and thus they won't buy, reducing aggregate consumption despite no change in real income. 

#### Inflation Variability

Changes in inflation can adjust the risk of certain financial assets such as bonds which pay a nominal amount after a fixed term. Inflation variability makes these types of investments more risky. 

### Benefits of Inflation
---

Despite the large costs of inflation, there are some benefits: 

#### Seignorage

Money creation can improve the governments ability to repay debts and finance spending, it is an alternative to taxes and borrowing. 

This however is risky and usually involves large inflation, a cost seen in Germany after the First World War as they repaid their reparations via money creation, causing the economy to collapse under hyperinflation. 

#### Negative Real Interest Rates 

An economy with higher average inflation has more scope to use monetary policy to fight a recession and return an economy to the natural level of output. 

Consider two economies: 

|                            | A   | B   |
| -------------------------- | --- | --- |
| Natural Real Interest Rate | 2%  | 2%  |
| Average Inflation Rate     | 3%  | 0%  |
| Nominal Interest Rate      | 5%  | 2%  |

Suppose there is a negative shock to an economy, the central bank aims to recover by lowering interest rates. Assuming inflation doesn't change right away, economy B has less ability to change interest rates despite having the same real interest rate. By setting the interest rate to 0%, A would have a negative real interest rate whilst B would have 0%, thus the former could respond to the negative shock more effectively. 

#### Money Illusion Revisited

Paradoxically, also provides an argument for having a positive inflation rate. Workers are very against wage cuts, therefore firms are more likely to increase prices than decrease wages. Furthermore, due to human irrationality, workers would tend to prefer to cut their wage *via inflation* (ie. a small increase in nominal wage and higher inflation) than to have no inflation and a reduction in wage. 

Therefore, Money Illusion itself can allow for downward wage adjustments more easily.

### Monetary Policy Rules
---
Until the 1990s, Central Bank policy focused around nominal money growth, whereby they chose a money growth target for the medium run. However recently, the design has evolved to where most central banks have adopted an inflation rate target rather than a nominal money growth rate target. 

#### Money Growth Targets and Ranges

As mentioned, prior to the 2000s, central banks chose a target rate for nominal money growth corresponding to the inflation rate it wanted to achieve in the medium run. 

> [!EXAMPLE]
> If wanted inflation was 4% and the normal rate of growth of output (growth caused by population changes and technological progress) was 3%, then the central bank chose a target rate of nominal money growth of 7%

In the short run, central banks could deviate from the target, if the economy was in a recession perse they were allowed to go above the target value to allow for a decrease in interest rate and more effective recovery in output. 

To communicate to the public, central banks announced a range for the rate of nominal money growth it intended to achieve, sometimes this is as a commitment, or sometimes it is simply a forecast. 

#### Reason for Change: The Relation Between Money Growth and Inflation

The reason Central Banks designed policy around nominal money growth was based on the assumption that *"there is a close relation between inflation and nominal money growth in the medium run"*. This is simply not the case. The relation is not very tight, sure there is a correlation, i.e. if nominal money growth is higher, inflation is likely to be higher, however not to the extent that central banks are able to map a nominal money growth target to a desired inflation rate. 

![[Pasted image 20230301132546.png]]
As shown in the figure, there is no tight relation between M1 growth and inflation, not even in the medium run. 

Consequently, Central Banks around the world updated their design, instead imposing a target inflation rate as this was what the central bank was trying to do in the first place... 

#### Inflation Targeting and Output

By focusing exclusively on inflation, it could be argued that this would remove the role of monetary policy reducing output fluctuations. This may not be the case though: the Philips relation between inflation and unemployment. Suppose the Central Bank had a target inflation rate of $\pi^*$ then inflation and unemployment changes over time can be described by:  

$$\large
\pi^{*}= \pi^{*}- \alpha(u_{t}-u_{n})
$$

This would mean that the unemployment rate would be equal to the natural unemployment rate since $u_{t} - u_{n}$ would have to be equal to $0$. By implication, output would be at the natural level. Therefore, the inflation target theoretically eliminates deviations of output from its natural level. 

Thus our premise is wrong, if there was a negative demand shock, the price level would decrease below our target level of inflation, and thus a monetary expansion is neeed
