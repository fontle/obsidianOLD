    *Impact of monetary policy on the economy*

## Describing the Economy
--- 
The economy can be described by three relations: 

### [[Okun's Law]]
---
**Okun's Law** describes the inverse relationship between unemployment and output growth. As unemployment increases, output decreases. 

$$\large
\frac{\bar{Y}-Y}{\bar{Y}}=-\beta(u_t-u_n)
$$

Where: 
- $\bar{Y}$ is the potential GDP
- $Y$ is the actual GDP
- $\beta$ is the responsiveness of growth to changes in unemployment rate
- $u_t$ is the unemployment rate
- $u_{n}$ is the natural rate of unemployment 

### [[Phillips Curve]]
---
**The Phillips Curve** shows the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment. As unemployment increases, inflation decreases. 

$$\large
\pi_{t}=\pi^{e}_{t}-\alpha(u_{t}- u_{n})
$$

$$\large
\pi_{t}-\pi_{t-1}=-\alpha(u_{t}- u_{n})
$$

Where: 
- $\pi_{t}-\pi_{t-1}$ is the growth rate. 
- $\alpha$ is the responsiveness of inflation to changes in unemployment.
- $u_{t}-u_{n}$ is the unemployment rate. 

### [[Aggregate Demand Relation|AD relation]]
---
The AD relation shows the relationship between output and money supply, as money supply increases, interest rates decrease, causing investment to increase and output to increase. 

$$\large
Y = Y\left(\overbrace{\frac{M}{P}}^{_\text{Money Supply }}, \underbrace{G}_{_\text{Pub.\ Spend}}, \overbrace{T}^{_{\text{Taxation}}}\right)
$$

We can assume the relationship is linear and that only the money supply is relevant: 

$$\large
Y_{t}= \gamma \frac{ M_{t}}{P_{t}} \xrightarrow{\text{Expressed as Changes}} g_{yt}=g_{mt}-\pi_{t}$$
Where: 
- $g_{yt}$ is output growth 
- $g_{mt}$ is nominal money growth
- $\pi_t$ is inflation rate 

This relation abstract the mechanism in the IS-LM model:
- An increase in the real money stock leads to a decrease in the interest rate. 
- The decrease in the interest rate leads to an increase in the demand for goods, thus increasing output. 
## Fisher Effect
---
If the nominal interest rate and expected inflation rate are not too large we can express the real interest rate as the difference between nominal interest rate and expected inflation rate: 
$$\large 
r_{t}= i_{t}-\pi_{t+1}^{e}$$
## Implication of Three Relations
- - - 
1. The nominal interest rate directly affected by monetary policy is the nominal interest rate  
2. The interest rate that affects spending and output is the real interest rate. 
3. The effects of monetary policy on output **depends** on how changes in the nominal interest rate translate into the real interest rate.
## Disinflation
--- 
We know from the past that **high inflation is a major issue** therefore a key aim for policymakers is to reduce inflation.

To reduce inflation (disinflation) through monetary policy, less money growth is required. However, we know that there is a trade-off between unemployment and money growth. As reducing money growth can reduce unemployment. 

Therefore, how should the central bank decide how this trade off is approached?
- - - 
We know from the [[Phillips Curve]] that an reduction in the inflation rate results in increased unemployment. Furthermore, we can assume that $\alpha$ is roughly equivalent to 1 and thus a decrease in the inflation rate by 1% $\approx$ 1% increase in the unemployment rate over a one year period. 
- - - 
For example, if the central bank wants to decrease the inflation rate from 14% to 4% and that $\alpha$ is 1: 

- To achieve goal in **one year**, then one year of unemployment 10%  above the natural rate of unemployment is required. 
- To achieve the goal in **two years**, then two years of unemployment 5% above the natural rate is required. 
- To achive the goal in **ten year**, then ten years of unemployment 1% above the natural rate is required. 

[[The Sacrifice Ratio]] is the number of years excess unemployment needed to achieve a decrease in inflation of 1%. If $\alpha$ is assumed to be one then so is the sacrifice ratio. 

### The Lucas Critique
--- 
The Lucas Critique says that it is **unrealistic** to assume that wage setters would not consider changes in policy when forming their expectation of inflation. 

If wage setter are convinced that inflation was going to be lower than in the past, they would decrease their expectation and thus reduce wages, price levels and actual inflation. Therefore eliminating the need for a change in the unemployment rate. 

As a result, **monetary institutions** have to be credible and trusted by wage setters, otherwise monetary instruments will have an undesired impact on price expectations which will in turn have an impact on actual price levels.
