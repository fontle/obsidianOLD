Expectations play a fundamental role in determining aggregate consumption (the total amount of spending on goods and services within an economy) since they signal what the general populace *assume* will happen in the economy. Potentially, these assumptions can become self-fulfilling. For example, if a large proportion of the population believe that prices will increase in the future, they will spend more now and demand higher wages, this relation is highlighted by the wage determination equation: 
$$
W=P^{e}\cdot F(u,z)_{-,+}
$$
Since, price expectations $P^{*}$ increase wages increase $W$. Furthermore, since wages are a component of
