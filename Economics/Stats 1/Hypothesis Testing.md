## Step By Step
---
### Hull Hypothesis
- Express the *null hypothesis* $H_{0}$ where the true parameter is equal to the observed parameter of the population
### Alternative Hypothesis
- Express the *alternative hypothesis* where the parameter is different to the observed value
- Alternative Hypothesises can be composite meaning there are multiple to possibilities
- They can be *one-tailed* where for example $H_{1}:\mu > \mu_{0}$ or *two-tailed* where for example $H_{1}:\mu_{0}<\mu<\mu_{0}$
### Test Statistic
- Express the *test statistic* which is a function of the sample data that we are testing. 
### Rejection Region
- Express the *Rejection Region* which specifies the values for which the test statistic will reject the null hypothesis.
- This is also the same as the *Critical Region*
