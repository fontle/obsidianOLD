[[Confidence Interval]]  in statistics are a range of values that are estimated to contain the true value of a population parameter with a certain degree of confidence, usually denoted as a percentage (e.g. 95%). They give an indication of the precision of an estimate.

## How to Find the Confidence Interval
---
1. Determine the sample statistic (e.g. mean, proportion) that you want to estimate ($\bar{x}$).
2. Determine the level of confidence you want to use (e.g. 95%) and find the corresponding critical value from a standard normal distribution table ($z$-score).
3. Calculate the standard error of the sample statistic by dividing the standard deviation of the sample ($s$) by the square root of the sample size.
4. Calculate the margin of error by multiplying the standard error by the critical value, $\large z \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$.
5. Add the margin of error to and subtract it from the sample statistic to get the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval:

$$\large 
CI= \bar{x} \pm z \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

The resulting interval can be interpreted as: "We are X% confident that the true population parameter falls within the calculated interval."
