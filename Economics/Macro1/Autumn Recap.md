## [[IS relation]]
---
- Equilibrium in the goods market can be described where output $Y$ is equal to the demand for goods $Z$. This is called the [[IS-relation]].

$$ 
\begin{align*}
\text{Goods Demand}:&\\
Z &= C+I+G+NX\\
\text{Equilibrium}:\\

Y &= C(Y,T)_{+,-} + I(Y,i)_{+,-} + \bar{G} 
\end{align*}
$$

## [[LM relation]]
---
- Equilibrium in the money market is defined where money demand is equal to money supply.

$$ 
\begin{align*}

\text{Money Demand}:& \\
M_d&= \underbrace{\$Y}_{\text{Nominal Income}}\cdot \overbrace{L(i)}^{\text{Nominal Interest Rate}}\\

\text{Equilibrium}:& \\
\frac{M}{P}&= Y\cdot L(i)

\end{align*}
$$

## [[Price Setting Relation]]
---
- The price setting relation shows how firms set prices relative to markup and wages (the major cost for most businesses)

$$
P = (1+\mu)W \quad \xLeftrightarrow{equivalent} \quad  {1 \over 1 + \mu} =  \frac{W}{P}
$$

- $\mu$ is the markup for each good
- $P$ represents price level
- $W$ is nominal wages

## [[Wage Determination Equation]]
---
- The wage determination relation shows how nominal wages are calculated.

$$
W=P^{e}\cdot F(u,z)_{-,+}
$$

- $W$ is nominal wages
- $P^{e}$ is the expected price level
- $F$ is a function of unemployment ,$u$, and institutional factors, $z$, such as trade union power.

## Short Run Vs Medium Run
---
- In the short run, variables are not fixed and therefore price levels and output can deviate from their expected and natural values respectively. 
- In the medium run, price expectation must equal price levels $(P=P^e)$; output and unemployment must also be at their natural levels $(Y=Y_{n},u=u_{n})$
