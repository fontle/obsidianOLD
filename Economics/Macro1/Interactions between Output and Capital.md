## Thinking about the Aggregate Production function
---
The aggregate production function explains the relation between aggregate output and the factors of production (**land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship**)

$$Y =F(K,N)$$

Where $Y$ is aggregate output, $K$ is capital, and $N$ is labour. For simplicity, we exclude the other factors of production. 

We will assume that a characteristic of our economy is **constant returns to scale** whereby if the scale of operation is doubled, then output will also double: 
$$2Y = F(2K, 2N)$$
thus,
$$xY=F(xK,xN)$$
The implication of such assumption is that we can rewrite the aggregate production function as: 

$$\frac{Y}{N} = F\left( \frac{K}{N}, \frac{N}{N} \right)=F\left( \frac{K}{N}, 1 \right)$$

Output per worker $\frac{Y}{N}$ can be expressed solely as a function of capital per worker $\frac{K}{N}$.

## The Accounting Identity 
--- 
- If we assume the economy is closed $NX = 0$. 
- If we assume public saving is equal to zero: $T-G=0$.
- If we assume that private saving is proportional to income: $S=sY$.
- Therefore $I_t=sY_t$
