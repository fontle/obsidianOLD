## Discuss the Role of Expectations in Determining Aggregate Consumption. What Are the Implications of Your Analysis for the Effect on todayâ€™s Output of the Announcement of a Future Monetary Policy Expansion?

Aggregate consumption is can be defined as the total amount spent on goods and services by consumers within an economy over a given period of time. Typically, we can model current consumption as a function of disposable income. Assuming a linear relationship, we can model consumption using the following formula, 
$$C = c_{0}+ c_{1}(Y-T)$$
Where $c_{0}$ is autonomous spending 
$$
\begin{matrix}
C(Y-T)&+&I(Y,r)&+&\bar G  \\
(+) & & (+,-) & & (+)
\end{matrix}
$$


$$
\begin{matrix*}
A(Y,T,r) &=& C(Y-T)&+&I(Y,r)\\
(+,-,-) & & (+) & & (+,-)

\end{matrix*}
$$

$$
\begin{matrix}
Y &=& A(Y,T,r) &+& \bar G \\
& & (+,-,-) && (+)
\end{matrix}
$$

$$
\begin{matrix}
Y &=& A(Y,T,r,Y'^{e}, T'^{e}, r'^{e}) &+& \bar G \\
& & (+,-,-,+,-,-) && (+)
\end{matrix}
$$
With this model, expected future output changes $Y'^e$ will positively impact actual output. Furthermore, an increase in either expectations of future taxation $T'^e$ or interest rates $r'^e$ would result in a reduction of actual output. Consequently, actual output is a composite of not only the actual values but also the expected future values.
