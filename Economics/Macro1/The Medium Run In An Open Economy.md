## [[Real Exchange Rate]]
---

$$\epsilon= {EP \over P^{*}}$$

Ways the real exchange rate can adjust
- Through a change in domestic price level, $P$ changes relative to $P*$
- Through a change in the nominal exchange rate, $E$

## [[Aggregate Demand Relation]]
---
The AD relation shows the relationship between output and money supply, as money supply increases, interest rates decrease, causing investment to increase and output to increase. 

## Closed Economy

$$\large 

Y = Y\left(\overbrace{\frac{M}{P}}^{_\text{Money Supply }}, \underbrace{G}_{_\text{Pub.\ Spend}}, \overbrace{T}^{_{\text{Taxation}}}\right)
$$

## Open Economy
We have to account for fixed exchange rate therefore the relation becomes:

$$\large 
Y = Y(\frac{\bar{E}P}{P*}, G, T)
$$

## [[Aggregate Supply Relation]]
The price level $P$ depends on the expected price $P^{e}$ and on the level of output $Y$. There are to causations for this:
- The expected price level affects nominal wages which affects price levels. 
-  Higher output leads to higher employment, which leads to lower unemployment, higher wages and price levels.
