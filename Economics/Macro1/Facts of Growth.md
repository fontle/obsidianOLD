## Standard of Living
---

Economists fundamentally care about **standard of living** not economic growth itself. However, Economic Growth has always been a quasi indicator of standard of living because we presumably care about **happiness**. 

Consequently economists try and adapt GDP data to be more representative of the standard of living in an economy. 

1. GDP is adopted to *per capita* thus accommodating for population size of the economy. 
2. It is adapted to *real* GDP per capita which accommodates changes in domestic price levels. 
3. It is adapted to **PPP** (purchasing power parity) which adjusts for cost of living in different countries by calculating a standardised basket of goods. 

One Issue with this approach is that it does not account for **income and wealth inequalities** within an economy. In theory, countries could have identical RGDP per capita yet one economy could have 1 person with all the money and other everyone has the same.

*ON AVERAGE* countries with higher RGDP per capita (PPP) have higher life-satistaction.

### Non Neutral Innovation

Sometimes innovation in richer countries can have a greater impact on richer countries than on poorer countries.
