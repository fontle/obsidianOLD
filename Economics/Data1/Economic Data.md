## Correlation Vs Causation
---
A [[Correlation]] is a measure of how related multiple variables are related to each other.

> [!caution] Spurious Correlations
> A correlation can be spurious whereby multiple variables are associated but not causally related. 

Correlations may be spurious for **two main reasons**:
1. **Omitted Variable** whereby a variable is left out of the study which would explain why the two variables are correlated. For example a negative relationship between icecream sales and umbrella sales, are not caused by each other but instead another variable such as the weather. 
2. **Reverse Causality** occurs when we mix up the direction of cause and effect. For example, ice cream sales do not cause the temperature to increase, but higher temperatures are likely to increase ice cream sales. 

A [[Causal Effect]] is when one variable (the *independent variable*) causes an other variable (the *dependent variable*) to change.   
	We can determine the likelihood of a causal effect by measuring how strong the correlation is between the two variables. 

## Making Predictions
--- 
[[Extrapolation]] is the process of estimating a value *beyond* the distinct range of a data variable: We assume that the correlation continues past our data set. 

This should only be used if there is both **internal validity** where there is a demonstrated causal relationship within the context of the data and **external validity** where you can generalise the findings of a study to other situations. 

[[Economic Forecasting]] is the process of making prediction about the economy indicators such as inflation, GDP, etc.
