## The Supply Curve
---

The supply curve for an individual firm $i$ is denoted as $S_i(p)$ and shows the quantity supplied by the firm at each possible possible price $p$. 

From this we can determine the supply function for the market: 

$$\large \sum^n_{i=1}S_i(p)$$

Where $n$ is the number of firms in the market. 

### Elasticity of Supply

Shows how sensitive quantity supplied is to changes in the price level. The steeper the supply curve, the more inelastic supply is. Graphically, it is the slope of the supply curve.

It is calculated using the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by percentage change in price:

$$\large \epsilon_{s}=\frac{\partial S(p)}{\partial p}\times \frac{p}{S(p)}$$

### Inverse Supply

Is the opposite of the normal supply curve and shows the price at which producers are willing to sell $q$ units of goods: $P^{-1}{_i}(q)$. 

### Producer Surplus

Is the difference between the price and the quantity supplied by the inverse supply curve. Graphically, it is the triangle between the price level and the level of supply.

It represents the difference between a supplier's reservation price and the market price.

## The Demand Curve
--- 

The demand curve for an individual $j$ is shown as $D_j(p)$ and shows the quantity demanded by the individual at each possible price $p$.

Like supply, we can represent the market demand function by summing individual preferences: 

$$\sum_{j=1}^{n}D_j(p)$$

We can also show **inverse demand** which represents the price consumers are willing to buy $q$ units of the good. 

Additionally, consumer surplus is the difference between the market price and the inverse demand function. Graphically, this is the triangle between the demand function and the price level. 

### Elasticity of Demand

Shows how sensitive quantity demanded is to changes in the price level. The steeper the demand curve, the more inelastic demand is. Graphically, it is the slope of the demand curve.

It is calculated using the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by percentage change in price: 

$$\large \epsilon_{d}=\frac{\partial D(p)}{\partial p}\times \frac{p}{D(p)}$$

## Assumptions of Perfect Competition
---
1. **Homogeneity**: The goods sold in the market are *strictly* identical. 
2. **Atomicity**: the number of buyers and sellers on the market is sufficiently large so that none of their decisions can influence the equi-librium price.  
3. **Free entry**: firms can enter and exit the market freely  
4. **Transparency:** all buyers and sellers know the price at which they can buy or sell the good.

**Partial Equilibrium** also assumes that markets act independent from each other.
