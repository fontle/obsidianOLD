## Characteristics of Marxism
---
Marx proposed a *stage theory of history* which he referred to as **historical materialism**. 

He believed that human history progressed through several distinct chronological stages: 
1. *Primitive Communism*: Characterised by communal ownership of property and an absence of class distinctions
2. *Slave Society*: A ruling class emerges that owned slaves and controlled the means of production, was able to extract surplus value from slave labour. 
3. *Feudalism*: A ruling class of landowners who controlled the means of production and exploited the labour of pheasants.
4. *Capitalism*: The ruling class consisted of capitalists who owned the means of production and extract surplus value from the labour. 
5. ***Socialism***: Marx believed that capitalism would eventually make way for socialism which was characterised by collective ownership of the means of production and the abolition of class distinctions. He believed this was necessary as it would reduce exploitation and improve equality.

### Crisis of Capitalism

Of course we are yet to see the so called *crisis of capitalism* which results in societies' transition to socialism has yet to be seen on a global scale. The preconditions for such crisis are as such: 
1. *Overproduction*: Capitalism favours the constant accumulation of capital and production for profit. However there is a theoretical limit to the demand for these goods, if there is overproduction, and the markets contain goods that cannot be sold, then there will be a crisis of capitalism
2. *Falling Profits*: As competition increases, capitalists must invest more to maintain their profits, this leads to a diminishing return of investment resulting in an eventual convergence of overall profits.
3. *Class Struggle*: Exploitation of the proletariat would result in collective action to resits, theoretically leading to both social and political upheaval (the immiseration of the proletariat)
4. *Contradictory Forces*: Marx argued that capitalism is based on contradictions such as the tension between shareholders & profit and labour & wages. These can lead to crisis if not resolved. 

## War Communism
--- 
Communism was born during civil war and amid terror. This created a volatile environment that tried to put communism in practice without an established administrative base. 

What followed was detrimental to early soviet economies: 
1. *Requisitioning*: Food was seized by the Red Army from pheasants
2. *Expropriation*: Class enemies (the bourgeoisie) had their goods and possessions taken.
3. *Money Printing*: Led to hyper-inflation which destroyed the market economy in an attempt to catalyse the abolition of private money. 

### The End of War Communism and the New Economic Policy
---
War communism was ended by revolts in 1921. Neoclassical economists such as Mises saw this as a vindication of socialism. 

In response, Lenin introduced the New Economic Policy (NEP) based of the following rhetoric:

	"One step backwards in order to take two steps forward."

The N.E.P was characterised by: 
- Putting agriculture back into the hands of pheasants. Requisitioning was ended.
- Industry decentralised.
- Monetary Instruments were reintroduced: A stable and convertible currency called the *chervonets*.
- The State was left with the *commanding heights*: large industry, banking, and infrastructure.

This was very successful for the soviet economy at reducing volatility however: 
- It was an ideological compromise leaving the leadership vulnerable to ridicule from more devoted proponents of socialism
- It was not suited to rapid industrialisation. Stalin feared war with Japan after 1927 and steel output was 23% of pre-war levels.

## Mises' Property Argument
---
*Mises (1920)* [1] argued that communism would eventually fail without private property, as without it there would be no market for the means of production, and thus no monetary price established for the means of production.

This lack of prices would limit scarcity information and thus hinder economic agents decision making to alternative use of capital goods. 

Hence pure socialism would result in excess waste as demand is used to realise what the economy values relative to other products: 
- Entrepreneurs will not be able to plan production
- Producers will be unable to change to dynamic consumer preferences 
### Additional Research and Criticisms
*Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner (1938)* [2] created the Lange-Lerner model of market socialism which agreed with Mises' premise of a priceless socialist economy, yet, argued that a market socialist economy could overcome these problems: 

	A market socialist economy would be able to replicate the general equilibrium of a market economy by setting up a planning board and using computers. Private property could be abolished and prices could still be used to allocate resources. 
	
*Hayek* (1937) stated the above argument assumes the existence of a `general equilibrium` and hence markets are dynamic and prices that reflect genuine scarcity are needed to move the economy in the future into equilibrium as they provide instantaneous responses to changing economic conditions.
