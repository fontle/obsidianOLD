## Why was Britain first?

### Better Geography
#### First Nature Geography
- Large, easily extractable **coal deposits**, such as the surface deposits in South Wales
- Good Climate, Britain had no deserts, good rainfall, and a **temperate climate** that allowed for a variety of crops and livestock. No major natural disasters allowed for long term investments to be carried out. 
- Fruitful soils, Britain has a large amount of **arable land** which meant it had a comparative agricultural advantage to other countries
- Vast navigable river-network reduced the cost of transporting goods around the country
#### Second Nature Geography 
- Great market access through sea and canal routes
- Good defensibility (being an island)
- Historical, pre-established cities: London, Liverpool, etc.

### Better Institutions
- Britain has the oldest continuously operating patent system, as early as 1449. 
- Britain had a democratic parliament that was politically stable
- Financial institutions in London enabled greater level of investment 
- Defined legal framework

### Knowledge
Britain had a large amount of *usable knowledge*. Whereby the technological advancements could be applied to industrial processes to enable industrialisation. For example steam power was applicable to mechanisation of textiles, iron production and therefore crucial to driving industrialisation.

Mokyr's main thesis is that knowledge played a central role in driving the Industrial Revolution in Britain. He highlights several mechanisms through which knowledge contributed to industrialization:

#### Technological Innovations: 
Mokyr argues that the emergence of new ideas and technologies was crucial for the transformation of traditional industries. He emphasizes the importance of inventions, improvements, and the diffusion of knowledge in fields such as machinery, agriculture, textiles, and energy production. These innovations enabled increased productivity, efficiency, and the development of new industries.

#### Intellectual Climate and Scientific Advancement 
Mokyr also emphasizes the role of the broader intellectual climate in promoting scientific and technological progress. He suggests that the scientific revolution, with its emphasis on observation, experimentation, and the development of new theories, created a fertile environment for innovation and the generation of usable knowledge.

#### Institutions and Incentives
Mokyr highlights the importance of institutional frameworks, such as patents, copyright laws, and scientific societies, in facilitating the diffusion and protection of knowledge. These institutions provided incentives for individuals to invest in knowledge creation and dissemination.

#### Cultural Factors
Mokyr also considers cultural factors that influenced knowledge accumulation and diffusion. He argues that the British society of the time had a particular openness to new ideas, a culture of practical experimentation, and a tradition of collaborative networks, all of which supported the spread and application of knowledge.

## Why wasn't Germany first? 

### Segmentation 
- Germany wasn't a unified state until 1871
- Consisted of 100 of independent states until Congress of Vienna (1814-15) where they unified to 39 states
- There were different dialects that had only a degree of mutual intelligibility with only neighbouring states with cultural and economic ties having easy comprehension. 
- There was also a large degree of internal warfare: Thirty Years and Seven Years wars. 

### Landlocked
- Most German states were landlocked except a few in the north of Germany that had access to the North and Baltic seas. 

## The Congress of Vienna 

The congress of Vienna which was finalised in 1815 was a diplomatic conference that aimed to re-establish stability in Europe after the Napoleonic Wars. It had an indirect role in promoting,

### Political Stability

### Economic Cooperation

### Legal Reforms 

### Infrastructure Development
