## Unemployment, Output, Inflation 

### Okun's Law

$$
\Delta Y=-\alpha(\Delta U)
$$

### Phillips Curve

$$\pi=\pi_{e}-\beta(U-U_{n})$$


### Aggregate Demand Relation

After rearranging the aggregate demand relation we get a relationship between output, consumption, investment, and government spending (if in a closed economy) 

$$Y=\frac{1}{(1-c_{1}+i_{2})}\times\left( c_{0}+i_{0}+i_{1}r+\bar{G} +c_{1}T\right) $$
