**Okun's Law** relates unemployment to output

As the difference between normal growth (*growth caused by increase in size of labour force through population growth or immigration, and labour productivity increases through technological progress*) and the actual growth rate of the economy **increases**, the unemployment rate **decreases**, this is **not 1:1** change though, since an increases in employment does not cause the same change in unemployment *(some of the jobs don't go to the unemployed, and some discouraged workers enter the labour market increasing unemployment when employment increases)*
$$ u_{t}-u_{t-1} = -\beta(g_{yt} - \bar{g_{t}})$$
- Unemployment rate: $u_{t}-u_{t-1}$
- Actual growth rate in year $t$: $g_{yt}$
- Normal growth in year $t$: $\bar{g_{t}}$
- $-\beta$ shows how responsive the unemployment rate is to deviations of output from normal growth.

The **Phillips Curve** relates inflation, expected inflation, and the unemployment rate. It shows that the inflation rate over the current time period ($\pi_{t}$) is the difference between the expected inflation rate ($\pi^{e}_{t}$) and the impact of unemployment on price levels ($u_{t}-u_{n}$): 
$$\pi_{t}= \pi^{e}_{t} - \alpha(u_{t}-u_{n})$$
Since expected inflation is mainly derived from a product, $\theta$, of the last periods inflation, $\pi_{t-1}$: 
$$\pi^{e}_{t}= \theta \pi_{t-1} $$
In the USA, peoples inflation expectations went in tandem with previous inflation, therefore $\theta$ was close to 1 and we can assume that $\pi^{e}_{t} =\pi_{t-1}$. 

Substituting this assumption into the Phillips relation we can derive the relation between changes in the unemployment rate and changes in the inflation rate: 
$$\pi_{t}-\pi_{t-1}=-\alpha(u_{t}-u_{n})$$
From this we can derive how changes in unemployment impact changes in the inflation rate over time periods. If there is an increase in the difference between the unemployment rate and the natural unemployment rate (the level required to keep inflation constant) then the inflation rate will decrease. This occurs since greater unemployment creates greater excess supply in the labour market reducing wage expectations, reducing the cost of production and thus price levels.

The **Aggregate Demand Relation** relates output to the real money stock, government spending and taxes based of equilibrium in both the goods and money markets:
