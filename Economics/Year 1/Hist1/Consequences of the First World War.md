## Sleepwalking
---
The degree of international trade the year before the first world war was unprecendented and a high degree of market integration. 

**Clark (2012)** argues Europe *sleepwalked* into the war:
1. The houses of all major European monarchs were releated, there was no 'unavoidable' war. 
2. The entry of the US was unexpected into the war due to a large Germand minority
## Consequences of the War 
---
- The first wave of Globalisation found an abrupt end, market inegration therefore decreased rapidly. 
- The Gold Standard was temporarily put on halt
- New ideas about managing an economy "a complete material preparation for socialism"
- There became strong government involvement in core industries
- All economies experienced capital destruction to some extent:
	- Britain lost 14.9% of its national wealth
	- France lost 54.7%
	- Germany lost 54.7%
- New economies emerged as a result: 
	- Czech-Slovakia
	- Poland
	- Austria
	- Hundary
- All parties experienced large amounts of debt:

| Debt as GDP% | Germany | UK   | France |
| ------------ | ------- | ---- | ------ |
| 1913         | 63%     | 33%  | 67%    |
| 1920         | 299%    | 144% | 135%   | 

## War and Suffrage 
---
The need to mobilise all labor increased its the position against capital. Furthermore, the increased labor participation of women increased their political participation. 

Many countries made universla suffrage after the war:
1. Ireland, Austria, Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary *1918*
2. Netherlands, Poland *1919*
3. USA *1920* 
4. UK *1928*

## Policy as a result of Government Debt
---
There were only few options the government could take when faced with government debt: 
- Raise Taxes
- Borrow
- Print Money (inflation)
- Default to foreign debt with great consequence (France occupying Rhineland in 1923)
## Consequences of German Hyperinflation
--- 
### Short term conseqeunces: 
- Savings were eroded while som forms of capital profited
- Less trust in the political system helped exteme parties take dominance such as in the HItler/Roehm coupd in Munich 1923
### Long term consequences: 
- France could not let go of reparations, whilst other allied economists such as Keynes found German claims in part legitimate. 
- This helped the Nazi party, figures such as Lord Halifax and others misunderstood Hitler's aims during appeasement politics after the war. 
-  German fear of inflation even though the Great Depresssion was more severe and caused by deflation. 
## Were Reperations too high?
---
- Germany borrowed the reperations from US and would have been able to pay them back. 
- Reperations put a high debt on the new democratic government 
- They laos created a division between France and England who had different approaches to war reperations. 
## Failed Coordination
---
- The new world order propsed by Wilson failed to materialise 
- The US pulled out of Europe after the war and behaved relatively isolaitonist 
- German democracy was young after WW1 and unable to guarantee economic success
