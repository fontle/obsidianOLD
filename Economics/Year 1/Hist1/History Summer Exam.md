The first age of globalisation (1870-1914) was a period of increased market integration driven by technological advancements and trade liberalisation. This resulted in the largest sustained economic development of the 19th century. Improved transportation, such as railways, reduced costs and facilitated the expansion of trade, as seen in the grain market. Countries like the US capitalised on their comparative advantage in agriculture, exporting wheat to meet high demand in countries like the UK (see figure 1). Political stability, with prolonged peace in Europe and a stable monetary system, including the gold standard allowed for greater economic integration and efficient price signals. The first age of globalisation was a transformative period marked by increased international trade, capital flows, and knowledge transfer, driving economic growth and development globally.

### How Does Convertibility of Bank Notes into Gold and Free Minting on Private account Ensure the Approximate Identity of Physical and Nominal Value of Gold Coins under the Gold Standard?

The Gold Standard enabled to maintain the stability of a currency and the value of money by allowing convertibility between bank notes and gold. Two-way arbitrage automatically stabilised the physical and nominal value of gold coins since if the physical value of gold was greater than the nominal value, the demand for conversion increases, reducing the supply of money in the economy causing it to appreciate relative to the physical value of gold. If the physical value of gold was less than the bank notes, demand for minting would increase resulting in an expansion of the money supply and decreasing the value of money in line with the physical value of gold. This allowed for monetary equilibrium and ensured the approximate identity of physical and nominal value of gold coins since a the money market automatically stabilised at equilibrium. 

### What Was State Socialism

State socialism is characterised by the central planning of the economy rather than market allocation through government fiat. In Das Kapital, Marx describes communism as the final stage of development, whilst socialism is the transitory period between capitalism and communism. He described a 'dictatorship of the proletariat' where the workers seize the means of production creating an absence of a centralised state. Since *state* socialism heavily relies on central planning, it deviates from Marxist communism. Furthermore, collectivisation of capital to workers still resulted in significant control by the state: In Stalin's first 5 year plan there were state-imposed quotas on individuals as both state-controlled (Sovkhozes) and collectively-controlled farms (Kolkhozes), thus the power of the state never truly turned to the hands of workers. Furthermore, central planning set prices which deviated from domestic price signals leading to pheasants withholding surpluses from the market. Overall, central planning limited the role of the market despite its necessity in determining value of goods, causing CESEE states' *prices* to deviate from the actual value of the commodities they were producing.

### QUESTION A: Assess the Relative Economic Strengths and Weaknesses of Britain, Germany and the United States in the 1870-1914 Period.

#### Introduction (150)
- - -
The first age of globalisation (1870-1914) outlined by the end of the Napoleonic war and the start of World War I highlights a period of global economic prosperity. Economies such as Britain, Germany, and the United States all benefited from a magnitude of converging factors including technological advancements in all sectors, from technological advancements in the first industrial revolution (1760-1840) defined by steam power and electricity in the second industrial revolution (1870-1914). Furthermore, the period of outlines sustained peace supported by the unification of both the United States after the Civil War (1861-1865) and Germany in 1871 provided a foundation for global economic integration. A focus on collaboration spurred by post-war optimism perhaps catalysed the uptake in governments adopting liberal policies contributed to significant increases in global trade. Another converging factor was monetary stability, the gold standard enabled automatic stabilisation of exchange rates through two-way arbitrage of gold and bank-notes, this made exchange rate signals easier for merchants to decipher since there was a central means of exchange between economies through gold. Despite remarkable convergences during the period, there are still factors unique to each economy that determined its development and performance during the period, and sometimes to its own detriment. 

#### United States (350)

##### Introduction (50)
Beginning with the United States, the *New World* economy was seen as a land of opportunity, a plethora of available land enticed investors from land-scarce Europe due to the lower prices. Figure 2 shows an land advertisement for westward emigration promising "low prices" highlighting one of America's greatest economic strengths of the time:

*Figure 3: Manhattan in 1865 [^3]*

Land is one of the means of production for an economy and was an essential strength in America's industrialisation and economic development during the second industrial revolution. Firstly, land provided the expansion of settlement and facilitated the vast population growth brought on by European immigration, it allowed cities such as New York to expand rapidly into vast metropolises that not only facilitated the demand needed for goods and services but also for financial services that create more complex institutions that the economy could use to prosper, this population growth can be seen in Figure 3, which shows Manhattan at the beginning of the second industrial revolution, previously a small settlement, the port city was able to grow westward to meet housing demands whilst capital flows from Europe enabled industrial opportunities. Engermann and Sokoloff (2000) argue that these factor endowments (including land and resources) had 'profound and eduring effects on the long-run paths of institutional and economic development' demonstrating land as a strength in American economic development. 

The function of Land and factor endowments is vital to understanding the American economic success of the period. Since population growth was catalysed by the promise of cheap land and abundance of resources, institutions grew from the demand of immigrants for housing, finance, and education. As a result, universities, banks, and stock exchanges were formed as a result of this immigration (which itself was spurred by the factor endowments of America), in turn this increases the quality of the second nature geography: infrastructure is built around settlements that have these complex institutions and services, thus incentivising further immigration and greater demand for said services. This virtuous cycle resulted in the vast expansion seen by America during the period. However, there were characteristics that came to a detriment to the American Development. Despite the abolition of slavery in 1865, and the unification of the United States after the civil war, there was still a great political and economic divide between the north and south of the American economy. The South, where slavery was prominent, relied on low skill, labour intensive sectors such as agriculture. Meanwhile, the North consisted of ever increasing number of European immigrants, which created the demand necessary for the virtuous cycle previously described to take place. Furthermore, this endogenously created two different types of transport infrastructure and city networks which did not favour the economic development of the South. Therefore despite massive aggregate gains in national income these were not distributed evenly amongst the population and created a divide that still persists to this day.

Figure 4: Linguistic map of Germany [^4]

Similarly to the United States, Germany was a unified near the second industrial revolution in 1871, however unlike the former, they lacked the plethora of land that enabled the american mass production model. In fact, Germany had many weaknesses that had to be overcome before the period of vast growth between 1870-1914. Firstly, there was vast cultural heterogeneity amongst states within Germany. Before the unification in 1871 and the Congress of Vienna (1814-15), Germany consisted of hundreds of independent states, of which had different dialects that made mutual intelligibility difficult between non-neighbouring states (see figure 4). Furthermore most German states were landlocked making trade more expensive with since sea routes were not accessible. Additionally, politically, Germany was not unified, religion and conflicted interests made implementing policy difficult, furthermore the lack of parliamentarian nor liberal culture meant that trade was shunted. In theory, this segmentation also limits the size of the market, and therefore industry was less likely to receive the scaling effects of Smithian growth as seen in America and Britain. 

Germany managed to overcome these barriers to development through a series of economic and political reforms that changed the long run growth path and facilitated vast economic development.
