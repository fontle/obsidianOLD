The price setting relation shows how firms set prices relative to markup and wages (the major cost for most businesses)

$$
P = (1+\mu)W \quad \xLeftrightarrow{equivalent} \quad  {1 \over 1 + \mu} =  \frac{W}{P}
$$

- $\mu$ is the markup for each good
- $P$ represents price level
- $W$ is nominal wages
