**Internal Validity** shows that there is a causal effect from changing the policy variable on the population. 

## Requirements of Internal Validity
- No measurement errors: the outcome needs to be accurate and consistent. 
-  The groups for repeated cross-sections need to have as near identical characteristics as possible before and after observation.
- The treatment group **should not anticipate the change in policy**
- No other policy should affect the outcome of the treatment group during observation
- The control and treatment groups need to follow **parallel trends** to allow for accurate counterfactuals.
