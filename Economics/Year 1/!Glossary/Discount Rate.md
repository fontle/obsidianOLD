- The Discount Rate, $\rho$, is the **degree of impatience** of the consumer:
	- If $r=\rho$ then the slope of any indifference curve along the [[Equal Consumption Line]] is equal to the slope along the budget line: therefore the at the highest level of utility the consumer will consumer the same amount now $c_{1}$ and the next period $c_{2}$.
	- If $r>\rho$ then the consumer will consume **more** in the second period.
	- If $r<\rho$ then the consumer will consumer **less** in the second period.
