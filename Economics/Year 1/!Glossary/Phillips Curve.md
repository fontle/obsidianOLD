**The Phillips Curve** shows the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment. As unemployment increases, inflation decreases. 

$$\large
\pi_{t}=\pi^{e}_{t}-\alpha(u_{t}- u_{n})
$$

$$\large
\pi_{t}-\pi_{t-1}=-\alpha(u_{t}- u_{n})
$$

Where: 
- $\pi_{t}-\pi_{t-1}$ is the growth rate. 
- $\alpha$ is the responsiveness of inflation to changes in unemployment.
- $u_{t}-u_{n}$ is the unemployment rate.
