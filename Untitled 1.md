$$
L^{D}=\lambda \pi ^{2}+(x-x^{*})^{2}=\lambda \pi ^{2} + (\alpha(\pi-\pi^{e})-x^{*})^{2}
$$
In medium run $\pi^{e} = 0$ 

Under rational expectations, agents will suspect expansionary policy if inflation is too low, 

${\pi^{e}}^"$



$$
\frac{\partial L^{D}}{\partial \pi} =2\lambda\pi+2\alpha(\alpha(\pi-\pi^{e})-x^{*})=0
