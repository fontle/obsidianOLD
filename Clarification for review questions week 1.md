In the answers for question 2/3 in the review questions for the Poole Model it proposes that the answer for money supply setting is $\sigma^2$, however the answer supplied simplifies to $0$: 
$$\begin{align*}\\
\text{var}[Y]&=\frac{\sigma^{2}_{u}}{4}+\frac{\sigma^{2}_{v}}{4}-\frac{\rho 2\sigma_v\sigma_{u}}{4}\\\\
\text{var[Y]} &= \frac{1}{2}\sigma_{v}^{2}-(-1)2\sigma^{2}
\end{align*}$$
