#### What Anna's Optimal Bundle?

Optimal Bundle occurs at when the price ratio $\frac{-p_{1}}{p_{2}}=MRS$

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{2}&= \frac{0.25x_1}{0.75x_{2}} \\
2.5x_{2} &= x_{1} \\
x_{1}+2x_{2}&=80 \\
3.5x_{2}&=80 \\
x_{2}&\approx 22.86 \\
x_{1}&\approx 34.29

### Problem 2.1

---

$$
	r = 0.1 \quad m_{1}=2000\quad m_{2}=1100\quad p = 1 
$$

#### What is the Present Value of Consumer's Endowment?

Present value is $2000 \times 1$ and future endowment is $2000 \times 1.1 + 1100 = 3300$

#### What is the Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)?

MRS is equal to $-\frac{MU_{1}}{MU_{2}} = - \frac{c_{2}}{c_{1}}$

#### What is the Budget Constraint for the Consumer?

$$
c_{2}=3300-1.1c_{1}
$$

#### What is the Optimal Choice for the Consumer, and how much Will They Spend or Borrow in Period 1?

At optimal, $MRS = -1.1 \implies \frac{-c_{2}}{c_{1}}=-1.1$ therefore:

$$
\begin{align*}
c_{2} &= 1.1c_{1} \\
2.2c_{1}&= 3300\\
c_{1}&= 1500\\
c_{2}&= 1650
\end{align*}
$$

Therefore in period 1, they spend $500$ and in period 2 they spend $950$

#### What is the Optimal Choice if the Interest Rate Changes to 0.2?

This would change the budget constraint to:

$$c_{2} = 3500 - 1.2c_{1}$$

Therefore the optimal choice would occur at the new condition:

$$
\begin{align*}\\
\frac{-c_{2}}{c_{1}} &= -1.2\\
c_{2}&= 1.2c_{1}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Therefore the optimal choice would occur at:

$$
\begin{align*}
1.2c_{1}&= 3500 - 1.2c_{1}\\
c_{1}&\approx 1485.33\\
c_{2}&= 1750
\end{align*}
$$

### Problem 2.2

Patience has the utility function $U - c_{1}^{0.5}+\frac{1}{1+\rho}c_{2}^{0.5}$ where $\rho = -0.5$ and where c1 is her consumption in period 1 and $c_{2}$ is her consumption in period 2. She will earn $100$ in period 1 and $100$ in period 2. She can borrow or lend at an interest rate of $10\%$.

#### Write an Equation that Describes Patienceâ€™s Budget.

Budget Constraint: Income = Consumption 

$$
\begin{align*}

c_{1} + \frac{c_{2}}{1.1} &= 100 + \frac{100}{1.1} \\ 
c_{1} + 2c_{2} &= 190.91 \\ 

\end{align*}
$$


#### If Patience neither Borrows nor Lends, what Will Be Her Marginal Rate of Substitution between Future and Current Consumption?

If she neither borrows or lends, Patience is along the equal consumption line and therefore the MRS is equal to $-(1+\rho) = -0.5$ 

#### Without Doing Any Calculations, Will Patience Consume More in Period 1 or in Period 2?

Because the interest rate $0.1$ is less than the discount rate $0.5$ the consumer will choose to consumer more in period 1. The discount rate acts as the minimum interest rate the consumer will lend at (reservation interest rate). 

#### If Patience Does the Optimal Amount of Borrowing or Saving, what Will Be the Ratio of Her Period 2 Consumption to Her Period 1 Consumption?

$$
\begin{align*}
U &=  c_{1}^{0.5}+2c_{2}^{0.5} \\
190.91&= c_{1} + \frac{c_{2}}{1.1}\\
c_{2} &= 210 - 1.1c_{1} \\
MRS &= -1.1\\
-\frac{\sqrt{ c_{2} }}{4\sqrt{ c_{1} }}&= -1.1\\
c_{2}&= 4.4^{2}c_{1}
\end{align*}
$$

#### Will She Borrow or save Money in Period 1? How much?

4. What is the MRS at a point $(x_{1}, x_{2})$

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{MRS} &= -\left(\frac{\text{MU}*{2}}{\text{MU}*{1}}\right) \\ \\
&= \frac{0.25x_{2}^{-0.25}x_{1}^{0.75}}{0.75x_{1}^{-0.25}x_{2}^{0.25}}\\ \\
&= -\frac{0.25x_{1}}{0.75x_{2}}
\end{align*}
$$

5.  What Anna's optimal bundle? 
		Optimal Bundle occurs at when the price ratio $\frac{-p_{1}}{p_{2}}=MRS$  

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{2}&= \frac{0.25x_1}{0.75x_{2}} \\
2.5x_{2} &= x_{1} \\
x_{1}+2x_{2}&=80 \\
3.5x_{2}&=80 \\
x_{2}&\approx 22.86 \\
x_{1}&\approx 34.29
\end{align}
$$
