Data is everywhere, from news, to the packaging of food. Everything and everyone can be a piece of data in a set. However, not all data is made equal. There are a few factors which impact how reliable a piece of data is, and whether we should trust it. This is vital for data scientists as it enables them to distinguish between observations that are valid to make statistics.

## Factors that Impact Quality of Data
---
1. How the data is **measured
2. How the data is **collected**
3. How the data variable is **defined**

## [[Sampling]]
---
Is the process of taken observations from a select number of observations in a larger population. Sampling can either occur **randomly** where each member can be selected equally as likely, or **systematically** to make it representative of certain **strata** (categories of each data point). 

[[Sampling Error]] is the difference between the sample estimator and the actual unknown population parameter. 

[[Sample Bias]] occurs when a sample is collected in a way that some members of the population are more or less likely to be included than others, and therefore the sample is not representative of the whole population.
