## Discuss the Role of Expectations in Determining Aggregate Consumption. What Are the Implications of Your Analysis for the Effect on todayâ€™s Output of the Announcement of a Future Monetary Policy Expansion?

Expectations play a fundamental role in determining aggregate consumption (the total amount of spending on goods and services within an economy) since they signal what the general populace *assume* will happen in the economy. It the price expectation within an economy is such that things are likely to get cheaper: $P^*<P$ then consumers are likely to delay their spending. On the other hand, if price expectations are such that the populace thinks goods and services are going to get more expensive: $P^*>P$ then consumer's will have a greater marginal propensity to consumer (lower savings rate) as in real terms, they believe their money is worth more now than it will be in the future. This narrative is supported by a paper conducted by Duca et al. (2018)[1] which found in a large multi-country survey of consumers across the Euro Area found that *"higher expected change in inflation is associated with an increase in the probability will make major purchases."*. Furthermore, pooling of the survey results suggest that for each percentage point expected increase in inflation the consumer's probability to spend increases by between 0.15pp and 0.39pp. This analysis can also be extended to interest rate expectations: if economic agents believe that interest rates are likely to decrease - perhaps due to announced monetary expansion - then consumers and firms are likely to delay spending. For consumers, this expectation anchors durables expenditure. Durables such as automobiles, furniture, and also homes are typically bought on credit which has interest. Consequently, any changes to expected interest rates would impact the decision making of whether to purchase the good now or later. 

$$C_{t} = C(W_{t}, Y_{Lt} - T_{t})$$
*Aggregate Consumption as a function of wealth $W_{t}$, income $Y_{Lt}$ and taxes $T_{t}$*.
Where current wealth $W_t$ is defined as the sum of current financial and human wealth ($W_{t}^{F}+ W_{t}^H$) and the expected present discounted value of net income $\text{EPDV}(Y-V)$ which is the amount a consumer is willing to pay in the present for a stream of expected future payments. 

$$W_{t}=W_{t}^{F}+ W_{t}^{H}+ \sum_{i=0}^{T}{\frac{Y^{e_{t+i}}-T^e_{t+i}}{(1+r)^i}}$$
