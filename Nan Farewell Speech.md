As we say goodbye to my nan, i wanted to say a couple things. 

I can't really remember my nan very well before her strokes... and i can only here anecdotes of her past life from my mum. 

but i do remember sitting on her blue leatherette sofa in between her and brian in now what is my uncle's house playing on Brian's gameboy whilst a lit cigarette she was slowly ashing into the tray on the floor. 

I still remember the smile i put on her face as she saw the shere joy that playing Tetris for the first time bought me. 

I also remember that smile when she gave me a nerf toy for my 10th birthday. 

Despite never being very close, I am grateful that I still was never forgotten by Nan; i still have the teddy bear she bought me when i was born, a white polar bear named Jimbo. 

and whenever i saw her she always made an effort to ask how i was doing even if her eyes seemed more interested on the old western movies that were always playing. 

It was difficult after Brian's passing, Nan's mobility decreased further and her mental state wasn't the brightest. Yet she always smiled whenever i went to her room in the care home with my mum. I remember seeing her for the last time, back in March. I didn't think anything of it at the time but she held my hand the tightest she every had and said goodbye. I didn't realise but she must have known it was coming. 

although today is about mourning the loss of my grandmother. 

i can lay my mind to rest in the knowledge that she went peacefully in the hands of the person that loved her the most. my mum.
