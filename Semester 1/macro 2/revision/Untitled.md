## Does the idea that markets are normally in a state of disequilibrium provide satisfactory microeconomic foundations for Keynesian macroeconomic behaviour?



Keynesian macroeconomic behaviour is describes an economy in which aggregate demand automatically stablises to an equilibrium with the productive capacity of the economy (could be a proxy for full employment). To answer, whether a state of disequilibrium provides a micro- foundation for such behaviour requires the micro model to converge to a point which is not the social equilibrium. 

## The Model

Assuming consumers maximise a utility function between consumption and leisure subject to a budget constraint where their real consumption is bound by their wage plus non-labour income (assumed to be equal to profits $\Pi$). 
$$
\begin{gather*}
\max_{U}\ U(C,L) = C^{\alpha}\cdot L^{1-\alpha} \\ 
s.t \\
P\cdot C = W(1-L) + \Pi
\end{gather*}
$$
Assuming firms maximise their profits $\Pi$ subject to a production function which solely relies on the amount of labour $N$: 
$$
\begin{gather*}
\max_{\Pi}\ \Pi = P\cdot Y - W\cdot N \\ 
s.t \\
y=F(N)
\end{gather*}
$$
Solving for first order conditions :
