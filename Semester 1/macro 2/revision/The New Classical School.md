# The New Classical School


## Policy ineffectiveness proposition PIP 

A hypothesis of new classical school of thought.

Claims that it is not possible for monetary policy to adjust real variables in both the short and run long. A form of *radical monetarism*.

1. Assume lucas aggregate supply 
2. Derive AD from quantity theory of money
3. Assume rational expectations. 
4. Assume a systematic monetary rule (random rule would increase variance so this is understandable)

New classical with monetarists on the point that rule > discretion (keynesian). 

Imperfect information prevent effective discretionary action by government including monetary power. Even unexpected actions would increase varianace of output. 

Monetarist fixed "no-feedback rule" vs new classical feedback rule

robustness: 

Lucas AS: relies on perfectly flexible markets: 
1. Contracts, 
2. Adjustment costs,
3. Prices are sticky
