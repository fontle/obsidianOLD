# Disequilibrium Model 


Unlike Walrasian thinking where agents are price takers: Neo-Keynesians (inclusive of disequilibrium and new keynes schools ) assumes ALL prices (therefore including wages, the price of labour) are treated as exogenous as to prevent *Arrow's Paradox* where agents are simultaneously price takers and adjust prices to level where supply equals demand. 

Disequilibrium thinking modified the Walrasian general equilibrium to constrain consumers and firms to not being able to buy and sell as much as they want.

## Walrasian-derived constrained equilbrium

### Consumers

Assumptions: 
1. Non labour income is derived from the profits of firm's $\Pi$. 
2. $L$ is proportion of time endowment spent on leisure (non-work). 
3. $N$ is time worked $= 1 - L$
4. Cobb-Douglas utility function assumed.
5. Consumer faces rationing constraint that prevents them from consuming and working as much as they want $N^{R}$. 
$$
\begin{gather*}
\max_{U}\ U(C,L) = C^{\alpha}\cdot L^{1-\alpha} \\ 
s.t \\
P\cdot C = W(1-L) + \Pi \quad \text{and} \quad \underbrace{(1-L) \le N^R}_{\text{quantity constraint}}
\end{gather*}
$$
### Firms

Assumptions: 
1.  Labour is the only factor of production and produces one output 
2.  The output of the firm  (and ultimately output of labour) is determined by a function $F$. 
4. The firm is quantity constrained in the goods market and cannot sell beyond $y^{R}$. 
5. $N$ is the employment level
$$
\begin{gather*}
\max_{\Pi}\ \Pi = P\cdot Y - W\cdot N \\ 
s.t \\
y=F(N) \quad \text{and} \quad y \le y^{R} 
\end{gather*}
$$
In this optimisation problem, a profit maximising firm would employ labour up to the point where the marginal product of labour equals the real wage. 
$$
\frac{W}{P} = F'(N)
$$

Labour demand determined by a function $N^d$ of the real wage (intuition: the lower the real wage the greater the amount of labour the firm will want to employ)
$$
N = N^{d}\left(\frac{W}{P}\right)
$$
Output determined by a supply function $y^{s}$ of the real wage (intuition: the lower the real wage, the lower the marginal cost, therefore the amount of output the firm is willing to supply increase). 
$$
y = y^{s}\left(\frac{W}{P}\right) 
$$
The quantity restraint for the demand for labour  $N^{R}$ is derived from the inverse of the production function at the output constraint: $N^{R} = F^{-1}(y^{R})$.

The quantity restraint for the demand for labour  $N^{R}$ is derived from the inverse of the production function at the output constraint: $N^{R} = F^{-1}(y^{R})$. 



Does disequilibrium explain Keynesian macroeconomic behaviour: YES. 

A rationing constraint in the output and labour market provide an outcome, where a feedback occurs if the rationing constraint is relaxed  and a keynesian multiplier can occur. Suppose an increase in N


In order for the rationing constraint to occur in the output market, the price has to excess the marginal cost. For a rationing constraint to occur in the labour market, involuntary unemployment must occur whereby the real wage is greater than the disutility of labour (adverse effects of labour)
