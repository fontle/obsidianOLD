One informeed party takes an action that another party cannot obesrve, and thus harms the less-informed. This is **asymmetric infromation** because of the hidden action.

For example, Insurance, once full insurance is provided to a consumer, they may elevate their risk once realising such fact. This increased risk is not accounted for when purchasing the insurance and thus is a moral hazard.
