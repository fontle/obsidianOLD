## 7: Economic Theories

**Using theories**
- "Theory" is used to simplify the combinatoric hell of economic data, without simplifying using theories, then "the amount of information we gather about the economy would be indigestible"
- Economists "forced to accept the need for simplification" through "theory construction" <=> similar to abstraction from computer science.

**Schools of thought**
- Different *Schools of Thought* a product of differentials in abstracting the real world into theories. 
- They are equivalent to paradigms and are analytical frameworks. 
- They can change in prevelance over time.

- Economics is prone to independence: *the study of economics is in a symbiotic relationship with the economy*. 
- They are often in competition with each other Neoclassical vs Keynesian vs Marxism etc. due to differing assumptions and viewpoints.

## 40: A Level Playing Field for Economic Ideas  

**Institutions Influence**
- ![[Political economy, the contest of economic ideas, Frank Stilwell.-3.png]]
- There is a direct link between competing ideas and competing material interests; link between selt-interest and ones own acceptability of competing ideas. 
- Different institutions can shape prevailing economic orthodoxy.  
	- *Educational institutions* can constrain doctrine to the scope of their curriculums. 
		- Lecturers more effectively teach their own viewpoints, bias. 
		- Institutions can have a history of specific school of thought, like Chicago. 
	- *Public services* like the treasury alter economic conditions, whose employees are usually grads from institutions which themselves instill orthodoxy. 
		- Interest rate policy is advised by biased intellects, not always diverse advisory boards. 
	- *The media*, some graduates go into journalism which changes the attention of economic agents and thus their active information set which they make decisions from. 
		- The media is a "crucial mediator between the price and political system", it is a bridge between the government and the free market. 
	- *Think tanks* created through corporate funds align information provided with values that also align with their own interests.
